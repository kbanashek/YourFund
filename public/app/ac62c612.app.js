When you plan a trip, first you select your destination, then you decide how you\'re going to get there.</p><p>Let\'s say you live in Denver and want to visit Chicago. You could choose to fly, drive, or take a train. The type of transportation you choose depends on how much time you have, how long you plan to stay, and how much money you\'re willing to spend. If you have plenty of time to get to Chicago, you can drive. Driving means using a map or GPS to determine which route you will take, researching where you will eat and sleep, etc. If your time is limited, you might choose to fly to Chicago, checking with the airlines to see which carriers service that city, along with the flight times and fares.</p><p>The same type of planning applies when setting your financial goals. First establish a specific goal, then map out a route of how to get there. Focus your goals on the events that have a significant financial impact in your life, such as getting married, raising a family, buying a home, funding a child\'s education, dealing with aging parents, and retiring.</p><h3>Identify Your Financial Goals</h3><p>Most people never take the time to identify their financial goals. They think about saving or investing in general terms, but don\'t specify what they are saving or investing for, nor do they think about how much money they will actually need to achieve their goals.</p><p class=text_ital>Here are some examples of general financial goals:</p><ul><li class=ul>Increase standard of living<br></li><li class=ul>Have sufficient funds in the event of a serious illness<br></li><li class=ul>Develop an investment program that will provide a hedge against inflation<br></li><li class=ul>Accumulate a sizable estate to pass on to heirs<br></li><li class=ul>Reduce debt<br></li><li class=ul>Retire comfortably</li></ul><p>Think about what on this list applies to you and your lifestyle goals. Once you determine your general financial objectives, the next step is to focus on your specific financial objectives.</p><p class=text_ital>Here are a few examples of specific financial goals:</p><ul><li class=ul>Pay for college<br></li><li class=ul>Buy a house<br></li><li class=ul>Make home improvements such as remodeling a kitchen<br></li><li class=ul>Buy a car<br></li><li class=ul>Take a dream vacation to Europe<br></li><li class=ul>Secure retirement income for at least 20 years<br></li><li class=ul>Save in advance of having children<br></li><li class=ul>Buy a retirement home<br></li><li class=ul>Retire at the age of 60<br></li><li class=ul>Start a small business</li></ul><p>Whereas a general goal might be "I want to retire comfortably someday," the specific goal would be "I want to retire at age 65 with enough funds to keep my current standard of living." Writing down clear and specific goals will help you identify your risk and investing preferences.</p><p>When setting your goals, remember to be realistic about reasonable returns from various types of investments. For example, if you are risk-averse it helps to have goals that are more long-term and involve lower rates of return versus a short-term, high-risk, potentially high-return investments.</p><h3>Factors to Consider when Setting Goals</h3><p>Once you have identified your goals the next step is to prioritize them. There are four factors involved in prioritizing your goals.</p><p class=text_ital>Each of them is equally important. They are:</p><ul><li class=ul>Investment Time Horizon<br></li><li class=ul>Priorities<br></li><li class=ul>Quantifying<br></li><li class=ul>Personal Investment Profile</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>'),a.put("app/Help/Help.html","<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class=\"page-header dark-green\">Getting Started</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class=\"panel panel-green\"><div class=panel-heading>Frequently Asked Questions</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p></p><h3>What products and services does STF offer?<br></h3><p>STF enables you to tailor your investments to your goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance level.

Do you wait until the gas gauge is almost on "E" before you fill up? If you answered yes to either, then you are probably a risk taker. Investing is ultimately a form of risk.<p></p>The risk of investing in a security (for example a stock or bond) is the chance that the investment will decline in value and you will lose your initial investment as well as any potential future gains. For example, imagine that you buy shares in XYZ company that makes compact fluorescent light bulbs. Six months later, another company introduces a new light bulb that is less expensive and more energy efficient. Sales of compact fluorescent light bulbs plunge and so does XYZ company\'s stock price. The value of your investment is now below what you paid for it.<p></p>Risk and return are directly related, so an investment that offers higher potential returns generally carries a higher risk. This is true in gambling as well. Let\'s say you\'re in Las Vegas playing Roulette. If you bet on number 18 at the roulette wheel, you have selected a very specific item with a 1 in 37 chance of winning. This is a very risky bet so if you win, you get a large payoff (return). On the other hand, if you bet on the color red (a more general bet), you have almost a 1 in 2 chance of winning. Thus the odds (risk) are lower, but the payoff is consequently smaller as well.<p></p>Unlike gambling, however, investing in the stock market is not based purely on chance. It involves thoroughly researching a company, analyzing the company\'s track record and assessing its potential to generate future income. While gambling is a one-time, immediate event, smart investing occurs over a longer period of time.<p></p>Generally, debt securities (i.e. bonds) have lower risks and offer lower returns while equity securities (i.e. stocks) have higher risks and offer higher returns. Highly risky investments, such as commodities (i.e. gold, silver) and hard assets (i.e. real estate), have the best potential for highest returns over time. However, these investments are the hardest to sell quickly and have the highest risk of declining in value.<p></p>Your Risk Tolerance Level indicates your emotional and financial ability to tolerate investment losses. People who don\'t like to gamble have a low risk tolerance level while people who enjoy gambling tend to have a high risk tolerance level. Over time, your risk tolerance level may increase or decrease as your investment knowledge, net worth, income or age changes. Generally, the younger and/or wealthier you are, the more you can afford to make risky investments.<p></p>Measuring Your Attitude Toward Risk<p></p><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>It is a good idea to gauge your attitude about risk. The following statements can help you determine your risk tolerance level. Select “Yes”, “No” or “Unsure” based on the assumption that you are investing money that will remain in the market over the next five years. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers.</p><table width=552 border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 bordercolor=#FFFFFF><tbody><tr><td width=326 bgcolor=#37864A class=text_chart_hedder scope=col>Measuring Your Attitude Toward Risk</td><td width=51 bgcolor=#37864A class=text_chart_hedder scope=col><div align=center>Yes</div></td><td width=49 bgcolor=#37864A class=text_chart_hedder scope=col><div align=center>No</div></td><td width=51 bgcolor=#37864A class=text_chart_hedder scope=col>Unsure</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D0D1D4><td><p>1.

This measure is called “beta”. Beta measures the volatility of a security’s return relative to the stock market. The reference point for beta is an overall measure of the stock market, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index.<br><br>In measuring risk, a beta of 1 means that the stock’s price is moving exactly with the market index. A beta lower than 1 indicates that the stock’s price does not fluctuate as much as the overall stock market while a beta higher than 1 indicates that the stock’s price fluctuates more than the market.</p><p>For example, Stock A has a beta of .65 and is 35% less volatile than the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index. Stock B has a beta of 1.4 and is 40% more volatile than the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index. Therefore, Stock B is the riskier investment choice. If you are risk-averse, you might find Stock A and other low-beta stocks as attractive options to add to your investment portfolio. If you like high risk with the potential of high returns, you would select Stock B and other high-beta stocks.</p><p>Stocks with high betas tend to rise more sharply than the market and can provide greater profitability in the long run. High-beta stocks tend to rise more than low-beta stocks in an increasing stock market, but perform much worse in a declining market.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Types of Risk</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Investments can be affected by various types of risk.</p><p class=text_ital>Here are a few that you should be aware of:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Business Risk</span> is the potential that a company may not perform well. One cause of business risk is the uncertainty about the company’s profitability. An example of this would be a biotechnology company that is focused on only one drug. If the drug fails to gain FDA approval, the stock of that biotechnology company might plummet.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Callability Risk</span> is the chance that the bond issuer may force bondholders to redeem their bonds before the bonds reach maturity. Callable bonds are those that the company can redeem before they mature. You would get your entire investment back plus the interest that is already paid. For example, if you have a 10 year, $1,000 bond which pays 10% interest annually, you receive $100 each year for 10 years. If the issuer “calls” the bond after the second year, you would have only received $200 of interest plus your $1,000 principal. You would not receive the eight additional years worth of interest payments or $800.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Default Risk</span> is the possibility that a corporation or other bond issuer will fail to make payments on the bond’s interest and principal. Companies might not be able to pay the interest or principal on their bonds due to adverse financial conditions or bankruptcy. The degree of default risk is related to the financial condition of the company issuing the security. If a bankruptcy occurs, bondholders do have a claim on the company’s assets, but might not get all their money back.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Interest Rate Risk</span> is a change in the price of a bond caused by market interest rate fluctuations. The majority of bonds have a fixed coupon, which means that you will be paid the fixed interest rate stated on the bond. If the market interest rate increases, the price of an existing bond with a coupon rate below that of the current market rate will decrease. This is because coupon income on the existing bonds is fixed and does not increase when the interest rate increases.<br><br>For example, you purchase a $100 bond with a 10% coupon so you would receive $10 per year in interest. One year later interest rates increase to 12%. The 12% bond would pay $12 per year in interest. Your 10% bond is not worth as much as a 12% bond on the market. Why buy a 10% bond paying $10 annually when you can buy a 12% bond that is paying $12 annually? If you wanted to sell your bond, you would need to sell it at a discount.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Investment Risk</span> is the potential that your initial investment may not yield the return you expect each year. Although it may return more than expected in some years, it may return less than expected in others. Some years, it may even have a negative return (i.e. loss of principal).</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Liquidity Risk</span> is the potential inability to sell the investment quickly. For example an investor might sell an investment at a discount if he or she needed to quickly convert that investment into cash. Trying to sell a house quickly in a recession is an example of liquidity risk.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Market Risk</span> is when sharp fluctuations of the market affect all stocks. When the stock market rises sharply, most stock prices increase. When the market falls sharply, most stock prices decrease. This happens regardless of how profitable a company is and explains why recessions can adversely affect even the healthiest of stocks.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Purchasing Power Risk</span> (also known as Inflation Risk) is the risk that the inflation rate will be higher than the rate of return on an investment. Ideally, the return rate on an investment needs to be at least as high as the inflation rate. Otherwise the amount earned by the investor will have less purchasing power than it did when the initial investment was made.<br><br>For example, if you invest $100 and get a 10% annual rate of return, at the end of the year, you’ll have $110. When you made the initial investment, inflation was hovering at 7% but due to a bad economy, by the end of that year inflation is up to 15%. Your 10% investment return did not keep up with the 15% rate of inflation and now your $110 will buy you less goods at the store.</li></ul></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel4 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Risk Pyramid</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p class=text_ital>This pyramid shows the highest risk investments at the top and the lowest risk investments at the bottom:</p><ul><li class=ul>High Yield Junk Bonds, Common Stocks<br></li><li class=ul>Preferred Stocks<br></li><li class=ul>Mortgage-Backed Securities, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds<br></li><li class=ul>U.S. Government Securities<br></li><li class=ul>Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Bills, Money Market Funds, Savings Passbook</li><li class=ul>Accounts</li></ul><p>You can find a company’s risk (also known as beta) on the Research page of our website.</p><!--<p>--><!--<script type="text/javascript">--><!--&lt;!&ndash;--><!--var CollapsiblePanel1 = new Spry.Widget.CollapsiblePanel("CollapsiblePanel1", {contentIsOpen: false});--><!--var CollapsiblePanel2 = new Spry.Widget.CollapsiblePanel("CollapsiblePanel2", {contentIsOpen: false});--><!--var CollapsiblePanel3 = new Spry.Widget.CollapsiblePanel("CollapsiblePanel3", {contentIsOpen: false});--><!--var CollapsiblePanel4 = new Spry.Widget.CollapsiblePanel("CollapsiblePanel4", {contentIsOpen: false});--><!--//&ndash;&gt;--><!--</script>--><!--</p>--></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>'),a.put("app/account/login/login.html",'<!--<div class="modal-dialog">--><!--<div class="modal-content">--><div class=modal-content><div class="modal-header panel-green-bg"><button type=button class=close ng-click=cancel()>&times;</button><h1>Login</h1><!--<p>Accounts are reset on server restart from <code>server/config/seed.js</code>.

if the company is financially sound or has potential issues. One way for you to analyze the financial statements is to create ratios which use data from a company’s balance sheet and income statement.</p><p class=text_ital>Ratios can be categorized into four groups:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Liquidity ratios</span> indicate the company’s ability to pay its short-term debts. Typically, these ratios are created by focusing on short-term items such as current assets and current liabilities. It is also a good idea to analyze the company’s individual current assets and liabilities on their own, outside of the ratio. For example, a relatively low cash level may indicate a significant liquidity problem, even though the relationship (ratio) between total current assets and current liabilities looks healthy.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Types of Liquidity Ratios:</span></li></ul><ul><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Current ratio</span> = current assets / current liabilities<br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Quick or Acid ratio</span> = (current assets – inventory) / current liabilities<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Leverage ratios</span> measure a company’s use of debt financing and its ability to pay interest expense and other obligations associated with debt or “debt-like” financing. There are four types of leverage ratios: debt ratio, debt/equity ratio, times interest earned, and fixed charge coverage. Leverage ratios are created by measuring the company’s debt to its total assets or to the stockholder’s equity. It is important to note that the higher the debt ratio, the more leveraged the company is and the higher the interest payments that they will need to make to their creditors.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Types of Leverage Ratios:</span></li></ul><ul><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Debt ratio</span> = total liabilities / total assets</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Debt / Equity ratio</span> = long-term liabilities / stockholder’s equity</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Times Interest Earned</span> = earnings before interest and taxes / interest expense</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Fixed Charge Coverage</span> = (earnings before interest and taxes + lease expense) / (interest expense + lease expense)</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Activity ratios</span> relate assets to revenue and are also known as turnover ratios. There are five types of activity ratios: inventory turnover, asset turnover, fixed asset turnover,working capital turnover and average collection period. These ratios essentially measure how well a company is using its assets. Higher ratios are generally more desirable because they are an indication of a healthier company.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Types of Activity Ratios:</span></li></ul><ul><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Inventory Turnover</span> = cost of goods sold / inventory</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Asset Turnover</span> = sales / total assets</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Fixed Asset Turnover</span> = sales / fixed assets</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Working Capital Turnover</span> = sales / net working capital</li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Average Collection Period</span> = accounts receivable / average daily credit sales</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Profitability ratios</span> show the relationship between profits, assets and sales.

These growth rates can be used in comparing the company with the industry average or other companies. These trends can show over time if a company’s revenues, earnings, margins, expenses, etc. are increasing, staying flat, or declining. If the revenues are increasing over time, but the expenses are staying flat or decreasing, the company is becoming more profitable and that is good. If the sales are flat, but the expenses are increasing, that is troubling and you would need to see which type of expense is causing the increase.</p><h3>Matters of size<br></h3><p>Publicly held companies can be classified by a term called “market capitalization”. Market capitalization is the price per share of a company multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.</p><p class=text_ital>There are three categories of capitalization:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Large capitalization stocks</span><br>The stock of companies with market capitalization of more than $5 billion.

Your body would eventually have problems because it would not get the nutrients it needs from just one food source. You need to balance your diet with fruits, vegetables, grains and proteins to keep your body going.</p><p>Just as you wouldn’t want to eat just one kind of food, you don’t want to put all your financial assets into one type of investment.<br></p><p>Asset allocation refers to dividing your investment portfolio among different types of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and cash. Your asset allocations should change during various times in your life, depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance level.<br></p><h4>Why Asset Allocation Is So Important</h4><p>By investing in asset classes that move up or down under different market conditions, you can better protect your portfolio against significant losses. Market conditions that cause one asset category to do well often cause another asset category to have average or poor returns.<br></p><p>With asset allocation, your portfolio\'s overall return will not fluctuate as wildly. If one asset category\'s investment return falls, you\'ll be in a position to counteract those losses with better investment returns in another category.<br></p><h4>Investment Choices<br></h4><p>There are many investment products to choose from such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange­traded funds. As noted above, investing in a variety of different assets is a smart strategy.<br></p><p>Stocks, bonds and cash are the most common asset classes. These are the asset categories you would likely choose from when investing in a retirement savings program or a college savings plan. Other asset categories include real estate, precious metals and other commodities. Investing in these asset classes typically is more risky. Before you make any type of investment, you should understand its risks.<br></p><h4>How to Get Started<br></h4><p>Determining the appropriate asset allocation strategy for your financial goal can be complicated. You are trying to pick a mix of investments that has the best chance of meeting your goal given your risk tolerance level. As you get closer to meeting your goal, you\'ll need to be able to adjust the mix of assets.<br>If you understand your time horizon and risk tolerance, you may feel comfortable creating your own asset allocation model. There is no single asset allocation model that is right for every financial goal. You\'ll need to do research and then choose the one that is right for you.<br></p><p>In most situations, it is best to diversify your asset allocation. But there maybe some circumstances when you choose not to vary the mix. For example, a 25­year­old who is investing for retirement in 40 years might invest entirely in stocks because she has the time she needs to recover from a possible falter in the stock market A family saving for a down payment on a house they want to purchase within the next few years might invest entirely in cash or CDs. The family needs to pay the down payment soon and cannot afford to take a chance on investing in the stock market in case the stock market goes down.<br></p><p>Neither strategy attempts to reduce risk by holding different types of asset categories. Choosing an asset allocation strategy won\'t necessarily diversify your portfolio. Whether your portfolio is diversified will depend on how you allocate the money in your portfolio among different types of investments.</p><div id=CollapsiblePanel2 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelOpen"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Changing Your Asset Allocations</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 937px"><p>The most common reason for changing your asset allocations is a change in your time horizon. In other words, as you get closer to your investment goal, you\'ll probably change your asset allocations to less risky assets.<br></p><p>For example, most people investing for retirement hold less stock and more bonds andcash as they get closer to retirement age. You may also need to change your asset allocations if there is a change in your risk tolerance, financial situation, or the financial goal itself.<br></p><p>Wise investors usually do not change their asset allocations based on the relative performance of asset categories. For example, when the stock market is going up at a fast rate (a bull market), savvy investors would not increase the proportion of stocks in their portfolio. Instead, they would "rebalance" their portfolios so as not to have too much of their investments in one asset class.</p><h4>Rebalancing 101<br></h4><p>Rebalancing is basically adjusting your portfolio so that it is realigned back to your original, targeted asset allocations. This is necessary because over time some of your investments may become out of alignment with your investment goals. Over time, some of your investments will grow faster than others. Rebalancing your investments ensures that your portfolio does not overemphasize one or more asset categories, thereby returning your portfolio to a comfortable level of risk.<br></p><p>For example, let\'s say you determined that stocks should represent 60% of your portfolio. But after a recent stock market increase, stocks represent 80% of your portfolio. You would need to either sell some of your stocks or purchase investments from an under-weighted asset class (such as bonds) to return to your original asset allocation mix.<br>When you rebalance, you should review the investments within each asset allocation category. If any of these investments are out of alignment with your investment goals, you will need to make changes to these investments to bring them back to their original allocations within the asset category.<br></p><p class=text_ital>There are three different ways to rebalance your portfolio:</p><ul><li class=ul>Sell investments from over-weighted asset categories.<br></li><li class=ul>Purchase new investments for under-weighted asset categories.</li><li class=ul><span class=ul>Modify the continuous contributions to your portfolio so that more investments go to under-weighted asset categories until your portfolio is back in balance.</span><br></li></ul><p>Before you rebalance your portfolio, you should consider the tax consequences or transaction fees that may result from each method of rebalancing.</p><p>Stick with Your Plan: Buy Low, Sell High - Shifting money away from an asset category when it is doing well to an asset category that is doing poorly may not be easy, but it can be a wise move. By cutting back on the current "winners" and adding more of the current so-called "losers," rebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high.</p><h4>Rebalancing Strategies<br></h4><p>One rebalancing strategy is to adjust your portfolio on a regular basis, such as every six or twelve months. The advantage of this method is that the calendar is a reminder of when you should think about rebalancing.<br></p><p>Another strategy is to rebalance only when the relative weight of an asset class increases or decreases more than a certain percentage, for example 15%. The advantage of this method is that your investments tell you when to rebalance. In either case, rebalancing works best on a relatively infrequent basis.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel4 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelOpen"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Asset Allocation Strategies</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 2163px"><p>Setting up an appropriate mix of assets in your portfolio to meet your goal is a dynamic process and an important step in determining your portfolio’s overall risk and return. Your portfolio’s asset mix should reflect your goals at any given point in time. Here are a few asset allocation strategies to consider.<br></p><h4>Strategic Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>Strategic asset allocation establishes a “base policy mix.” This is a mix of asset classes in proportion to one another based on their expected rates of return. For example, if stocks have historically returned 10% per year and bonds have returned 5% per year, a mix of 50% stocks and 50% bonds would be expected to return 7.5% per year (50% * 10% + 50% * 5% = 7.5%).<br></p><p>This strategy creates an asset mix that will provide the optimal balance between expected risk and return for a long­term investment horizon. With this strategic allocation method, the investor selects certain investments that will hopefully minimize risk (i.e. bonds) and also selects other investments that generate an expected minimum return (i.e. stocks, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds).<br></p><p>It is a good idea to rebalance your portfolio at least once a year. This keeps your overall stock/bond ratio in the proportions you want as the ratios might be off from your target. Over time, stocks or bonds could outperform the other and make you overweight in stocks and underweight in bonds or vice versa. By rebalancing back to your target, you are taking some of your profit by selling high and reinvesting it in assets that are lagging, thereby buying low.<br></p><h4>Constant­Weighting Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>The constant­weighting strategy of allocating your assets enables you to continually rebalance your portfolio. For example, if one asset were declining in value, you would purchase more of that asset, and if that asset value should increase, you would sell some of it. A common rule of thumb to rebalance is that a portfolio should be rebalanced to its original mix when any given asset class moves more than 5% from its original value.<br>The downsides of this strategy are that it is time­consuming and broker trading fees can get expensive.<br></p><h4>Tactical Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>Once in awhile you may want to consider deviating from your asset mix to take advantage of unusual or exceptional investment opportunities. This flexibility adds a component of market timing to the portfolio, allowing you to participate in economic conditions that are more favorable for a specific asset class. This is known as “tactical asset allocation”.<br></p><p>Tactical asset allocation is a moderately active strategy, since you would return to your overall asset mix when the desired short­term profits are achieved. This strategy requires discipline since you must be able to recognize when the short­term opportunities are finished, and then rebalance your portfolio back to your long­term strategy.<br></p><p>With the tactical strategy, you try to position your portfolio into those specific assets, sectors, or stocks that show the most potential for gains. Tactical investors try to buy into asset classes that are on an upward move. If you are someone who jumps out of stocks and into bonds when the stock market heads south, or dumps your money into gold because that’s the current hot commodity, you’re probably a tactical investor.<br></p><p>This asset allocation strategy is riskier than others because it is an active approach. Anyone can have a hot streak or get lucky, but don’t forget that even the best money managers can’t consistently outperform the market forever. This strategy is not well­suited for long­term assets such as those used for retirement.<br></p><h4>Dynamic Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>Dynamic asset allocation is also an active strategy where you constantly adjust the mix of assets as the stock and bond markets rise and fall and the economy strengthens and weakens. Dynamic asset allocation is the opposite of a constant­weighting allocation strategy. With the dynamic strategy, you sell assets that are declining and purchase assets that are increasing. If the stock market is declining, you sell stocks in anticipation of further decreases, and if the stock market is rising, you buy stocks in anticipation of continued market gains.<br></p><h4>Insured Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>In an insured asset allocation strategy, you determine a minimum “base portfolio value” floor, below which the portfolio should not be allowed to drop. As long as your portfolio achieves a rate of return above this base value, you can actively manage your portfolio to try to increase its value as much as possible. If the portfolio should ever drop to the base value, you would invest in risk­free assets such as US bonds, certificate of deposits, etc. so that the base value becomes fixed.<br></p><p>There are two different approaches to create the insured asset allocation strategy.<br>The first is a formula approach. As the portfolio value decreases, you purchase more and more risk­free assets such as cash so that when the portfolio reaches its base level, you are entirely invested in risk­free assets.<br></p><p>The second is a portfolio insurance approach where you use options such as put options and/or futures contracts to preserve your base value. When the base amount is reached, you adopt a passive investing approach.<br></p><p>Both of these approaches are advanced active management strategies for more expert investors to use.<br></p><p>Insured asset allocation may be suitable for risk­averse investors who want some active portfolio management but appreciate the security of a guaranteed base value floor. If you want to establish a minimum standard of living during your retirement, an insured asset allocation strategy might be a good way to achieve your goals.<br></p><h4>Integrated Asset Allocation<br></h4><p>With an integrated asset allocation strategy, you consider both your economic expectations and your risk tolerance level in establishing an asset mix. Integrated asset allocation takes into account your expectations of the economy and stock market as well as the actual changes in the stock market and your risk tolerance level.<br></p><p>For example, if you think the economy will be very strong and the stock market will go up and you are not risk averse, you would invest more in stocks than in bonds.<br>An integrated allocation strategy is a broader asset allocation strategy which allows for a dynamic or constant­weighting allocation. Obviously, an investor would not wish to</p><p>implement two strategies that are competing with one another. For example, you would probably not integrate a dynamic strategy which is an active strategy with a strategic asset allocation strategy which is more long term in its approach.<br></p><h4>Core­Satellite Asset Allocation<br></h4><p><span class=text_ital>The core­satellite asset allocation strategy is a hybrid of both the strategic and tactical allocation strategies. With this strategy, your portfolio is essentially made up of two components:</span><br></p><ul><li class=ul>A core holding of stocks, bonds, exchange­traded funds or index funds make up the majority of your portfolio. This is the strategic component of this core­satellite allocation. The core of your portfolio may consist of anywhere from 50­80% of your total portfolio.</li><li class=ul>The remaining portion of your portfolio is your satellite allocation which is a tactical approach. While your core holdings make up the majority of your portfolio and won’t change much over time, your tactical component allows you to investigate opportunities in the market. This is the active component of the strategy where you to try to take advantage of trends without risking your entire portfolio.<br></li></ul><p>This strategy is great for those who want to be more involved with their investments, but who are not risking their entire portfolio. With the majority of your holdings in a passive strategy, you will still generally follow the market with relative ease, but you also have the potential to enhance your gains (and possibly losses) by managing some of your money on your own.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelOpen"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>To Sum Up</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 367px"><p>Asset allocation strategies can be an active or passive process or a mix of both. Your choice of a specific asset allocation strategy or a combination of different strategies depends on your goals, time frame, market expectations, and risk tolerance level.</p><p>Be aware that active allocation strategies that rely on anticipating and reacting to market movements require a great deal of expertise in order to try to time these movements. Accurately timing the market is next to impossible, so make sure your strategy isn’t too vulnerable to unforeseeable situations.<br></p><h4>Which Strategy to Choose?<br></h4><p>There’s no right or wrong asset allocation strategy because it really depends on your comfort level and how active you want to be in managing your portfolio. Most people will benefit from taking a traditional approach that consists of creating a tried and true mix of stocks and bonds suitable for their time frame and risk tolerance. Obviously the recent recession and stock market performance has a lot of investors thinking twice about this strategy.</p><p>So, what kind of asset allocation strategy should you use? If you are thinking about adding some tactical investing to your portfolio, it’s important to keep trading costs down as frequent trading and commissions can have a negative impact on your total return.</p><p><br></p></div></div><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- end #mainContent --></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/definitions/definitions.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>In Progress</p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/etfs/etfs.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a like a stock in that it trades on an exchange, but is like a mutual fund in that it tracks an index, a commodity, or a group of assets.

These statements show a company’s financial performance and health. Therefore it is essential that you learn how to understand and interpret them. A company’s financial statements are used in fundamental analysis to help make investment decisions.</p><p>The amount of information in a company's financial statements can be intimidating, but if you know how to analyze the data, the financial statements can provide a wealth of information. There are three major financial statements: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement.</p><div id=CollapsiblePanel2 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>The Income Statement</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>The income statement measures a company's performance over a specific time frame such as a month, a quarter (three months), or a year. It shows how much money the company generated (revenue), how much it spent (expenses) and the difference between the two (profit) over a specific time.</p><p>Published in a company’s annual report and quarterly Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the income statement contains the numbers most often discussed when a company announces its results. It shows how well the company’s business is performing such as whether or not the company is making money. Companies should be able to bring in more money than they spend or they won’t stay in business for long. Companies with low expenses relative to revenue - or high profits relative to revenue - signal strong fundamentals to investors. Strong fundamentals are good because that indicates the company is financially sound; it is profitable and has good cash flow.</p><p>There are two main categories found on the income statement: revenue and expenses.</p><h4>Revenue</h4><p>Revenue, also known as sales, is the most straightforward part of the income statement. This represents all the money a company brought in during a specific time period. Larger companies sometimes break down revenue by business segment or geography.</p><p>The best way for a company to improve profitability is to increase its sales. For example, Starbucks Coffee has aggressive long-term sales growth goals which include expanding its stores worldwide. Consistent sales growth has been a strong driver of Starbucks’ profitability.</p><p>The best revenues are those that (are consistent or continue to grow) each year. Temporary revenue increases, such as those resulting from a short-term sales promotion, do not have the same quality as on-going continuous sales since they are only short-term revenue increases. When the promotion ends, the revenue declines.</p><h4>Expenses</h4><p class=text_ital>There are various types of expenses, but the two most common categories are:<br></p><ul><li class=ul>Cost of goods sold (COGS)<br></li><li class=ul>Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A)</li></ul><p>Cost of goods sold is the expense that is directly involved in creating revenue. It is the cost of producing or purchasing the products or services sold by the company. For example, Target pays a supplier $4 for a box of soap, which it then sells to customers for $5. When it is sold, Target’s cost of goods sold for the box of soap would be $4.</p><p>Selling, general and administrative costs are those expenses involved in running the business. These include marketing, salaries, office supplies, utility bills, research and development, rent and other general costs associated with running a business. SG&amp;A also includes costs such as depreciation and amortization, which are accounting concepts used to value an asset (such as machinery) over the life of that asset. Machinery, as it is used and begins to age, becomes less valuable. A company will expense part of the cost of that machinery each year that the machine is used.</p><p>Finally, there are additional financial costs, such as taxes and interest payments. These are monitored as well and featured on a company’s income statement.</p><h4>The Bottom Line: Revenue - Expenses = Profit<br></h4><p>Total revenue minus total expenses equals profit, also known as net income. There are several profit categories that show how the company is performing.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Profit &amp; Margins</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Gross Profit &amp; Gross Margins</h4><p>Gross profit (also known as gross income) is revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). Using the Target example, the gross profit from the sale of the soap is $1 ($5 sales price less $4 cost of goods sold = $1 gross profit). The ratio of the gross profit divided by revenue is called gross margin. In this example, the gross margin is $1/$5 or 20%. As an aside, 20% can be a great, good, or bad gross margin percentage depending on the average gross margin percentage for the industry and the gross margin percentage for a company’s competitors.</p><p>Companies with high gross margins will have a lot of money leftover to spend on other business operations, such as research and development or marketing. An investor should keep a sharp eye out for downward trends in the gross margins over time. This is a sign of future problems facing the bottom line. When cost of goods sold rises rapidly, they are likely to lower gross profit margins, unless the company can pass these costs onto customers in the form of higher prices.</p><h4>Operating Profit &amp; Operating Margin</h4><p>Operating profit (also known as operating income) is revenue minus both the cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A. This is the profit a company made from its actual operations, but excludes certain expenses and revenues that may not be related to its central operations. Operating profit measures how much cash the business makes as a whole, therefore some analysts consider it a more reliable measure of profitability.</p><p>Operating margin is the operating profit divided by revenue. A high operating margin can mean the company has effective control of costs or that sales are increasing at a faster rate than the operating costs. In other words, for every dollar of revenue, a large percentage of that dollar is income. Analysts view a high operating margin as desirable because this means that the company has a good cash flow and a good handle on its expenses.</p><h4>Net Profit</h4><p>Net profit (also known as net income) is the company's profit after all expenses have been paid. It is the revenue minus the cost of goods sold, SG&amp;A and financial expenses such as interest expense and taxes. Net profit is called the \"bottom line\" and is usually the number people refer to when they use the word \"profit\" or \"earnings\". The net profit margin is obtained by dividing the net income by revenue.</p><p>When a company has a high net profit margin, it can mean that it also has one or more advantages over its competition. Companies with higher net profit margins have a bigger cash cushion to protect themselves during an economic downturn. On the other hand, companies with low profit margins can get wiped out in a downturn. Because of their healthy financial status, companies with higher profit margins are able to improve their market share during the hard times. This gives them a competitive advantage and leaves them better positioned when the economy improves.</p><h4>Income Statement Conclusion</h4><p>A company’s income statement can yield valuable insights into its fundamentals. Increasing sales shows the first sign of strong fundamentals while increasing margins indicate improving efficiency and profitability. It is a good idea to determine what the company’ sales and margins are compared to its industry peers and competitors. You should look for changes in revenues, costs of goods sold and SG&amp;A to get a sense of the company’s profit fundamentals.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>The Balance Sheet</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial condition, is a snapshot of a company's health at a specific point in time. The point in time could be the end of a month, quarter, or year. It tells you how much a company owns (its assets) and how much it owes (its liabilities). The difference between what it owns and what it owes is called equity or \"shareholder equity\".</p><p><span class=text_ital>The balance sheet is named because a business's financial structure balances in the following manner:</span><br><br>Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity<br></p><h4>The Balance Sheet’s Three Main Components</h4><p>The three main components of the balance sheet can tell investors a lot about a company's fundamentals. These three are: Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity.</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Assets</span><br>Assets represent the resources a company owns or controls at a specific point in time. These include items such as cash, inventory, machinery, land and buildings. There are two main types of assets: current assets and non-current assets.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Current Assets</span>:<br><br>Current assets are those assets that are likely to be used up or converted into cash within the next twelve months. This twelve month timeframe is known as a business cycle. Three important current assets are: cash, inventories and accounts receivables.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Cash</span>:<br><br>Cash is necessary to run a business. Cash offers protection against tough economic times and also gives companies more options for future growth. Growing cash often signals a strong company performance. It shows that cash is accumulating so quickly that management doesn't have time to figure out how to make use of it. On the other hand, a decreasing cash supply could be a sign of trouble. It is good that a company has a cash cushion (in other words has some cash on hand) in case of a financial downturn.<br><br>If there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet for a short time, such as three or six months, that could be fine. The company might be deciding if it wants to invest it in new machinery or research and development. However, if a lot of cash is a permanent feature of the company's balance sheet, investors need to ask why the money is not being put to use. A high cash balance could be because management has run out of investment opportunities or is too short-sighted to know what to do with the money.<br><br>One way to see how a company is using its cash is to review the company’s annual report to see if they investing the cash in new factories or machinery. The annual report would also show if the company is investing its money in interest-bearing accounts, is using the cash to buy back stock if management thinks the stock is priced below its value, or begin issuing a dividend.<br><br>An example of a company with a lot of cash is Apple. Even though Apple was investing a lot of its cash into research and development, it had a very high cash balances for many years. Apple decided to issue dividends to its shareholders to bring down its cash balance and improve the shareholder’s investment.<br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Inventories</span><br><br>Inventories are finished or partially finished products that haven't been sold. Companies have limited money available to invest in inventory. To generate the cash to pay bills and return a profit, they must sell the merchandise they have purchased from suppliers. The inventory turnover ratio (cost of goods sold divided by average inventory) measures how quickly the company is moving merchandise through the warehouse to customers. If inventory is growing faster than sales, it is almost always a sign of deteriorating fundamentals.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Accounts Receivables</span><span class=text_bld>:<br><br></span>Accounts receivables are uncollected bills from a company’s customers. Analyzing how fast a company collects what it is owed can tell a lot about its financial efficiency. If a company's collection period is getting longer, it could mean problems ahead. The company may be letting customers stretch their credit in order to recognize higher sales. This can be trouble later, especially if the customers face a cash crunch. Getting paid quickly is preferable to waiting for it since some of what is owed may never get paid. The faster a company gets its customers to pay, the sooner it has cash to pay for salaries, merchandise, equipment, loans, and best of all, dividends and growth opportunities.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Non-Current Assets</span><span class=text_bld>:<br><br></span>Non-current assets are defined as anything that is not a current asset. This includes a company’s property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) which are known as fixed assets. Unless the company is in financial distress and is liquidating its assets, investors do not need to pay too much attention to fixed assets. Companies are often unable to sell their fixed assets within a reasonable timeframe such as three to six months. Fixed assets are listed on the balance sheet at their cost to the company, regardless of their actual value. As a result, it is possible for companies to inflate this number, leaving investors with questionable and hard-to-compare asset figures. One way to check this is to compare the non-current asset values from the prior annual report to the current annual report to see if the values have changed. If the company has not invested in new equipment, the property, plant and equipment amount should have decreased.<br><br></li><li class=ul><strong>Liabilities</strong><br><br>Liabilities represent debt which must be paid back. There are two categories of liabilities: current liabilities and non-current liabilities.<br><br>Current liabilities are the payments a company owes that are due within the next twelve months, including payments owed to suppliers. Non-current liabilities are payments that have a due date more than a year out and include items such as bank and bondholder debt.<br><br>A low amount of debt is a good sign of a company’s financial health. Falling debt levels are also a good sign. A company with more assets than liabilities is considered to be in good financial shape. On the other hand, a company with more liabilities than assets should be closely examined. A company that has too much debt relative to the cash that is required to pay its interest and debt can eventually go bankrupt.<br><br>A helpful tool to determine this is the quick ratio. The quick ratio measures a company’s ability to pay its current debts by taking the current assets, subtracting the inventory and then dividing that number by the current liabilities. If the quick ratio is 1 or higher, it indicates that the company has enough cash and other current assets to cover its short-term debt obligations.<br><br>Quick Ratio =<br>Current Assets - Inventories<br>_______________________<br><br>Current Liabilities<br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Equity</span><br><br>Equity is the total value of the money that the owners have contributed to the business. Equity is what the shareholders own, so it is often called shareholders’ equity. Equity is total assets minus total liabilities.<br><br>Equity = Total Assets – Total Liabilities<br><br>There are two important equity components: paid-in capital and retained earnings. Paid-in capital is the amount of money shareholders paid for their shares when the stock was first offered to the public. It is the money the company received when it sold its shares. Retained earnings are the profits made in previous years. This is the money the company has chosen to reinvest in the business rather than pay to shareholders in the form of dividends. Investors should look closely at how a company puts retained capital to use and how a company generates a return on it.</li></ul><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel4 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Cash Flow Statement</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>The cash flow statement, also called “change in working capital”, shows how much cash comes in and goes out of the company over a quarter or a year. This sounds like the income statement in that it records financial performance over a specific period, but there is a big difference between the two.</p><p>The difference between the two is that the income statement uses accrual accounting. Accrual accounting requires companies to record revenues and expenses when transactions occur, not when cash is exchanged. The income statement often includes non-cash revenues or expenses such as depreciation. On the other hand, the cash flow statement does not include any non-cash items.</p><p>For example, the income statement could show net income of $10, but this does not means that cash on the balance sheet will increase by $10. When the bottom of the cash flow statement reads $10 net cash inflow, that's exactly what it means. The company has $10 more in cash than at the end of the last financial period. The net cash from operations is the company's \"true\" cash profit.</p><p>The cash flow statement shows how the company is able to pay for its operations and future growth. As a potential investor, one of the most important factors you should be examining is a company’s ability to produce cash. Just because a company shows a profit on the income statement doesn't mean it is immune to trouble later on due to insufficient cash flows. Examining the cash flow statement of a company is a good indicator of how the company will do.</p><p class=text_ital>A statement of cash flows usually focuses on the following cash-related activities:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Operating Cash Flow (OCF):</span> cash that is generated from day-to-day business operations.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Cash From Investing (CFI):</span> cash that is used for investing in assets, as well as the proceeds from the sale of other businesses, equipment or long-term assets.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Cash From Financing (CFF):</span> cash that is paid or received from the issuing and borrowing of funds. This includes loans.</li></ul><p>The cash flow statement is important to review because it is very difficult for a business to manipulate its cash situation. In other words, it’s tough to fake cash in the bank. Many investors use the cash flow statement as a more conservative measure of a company's true performance.</p><h4>Cash Flow Statement - Three Main Sections</h4><p>Companies earn and use cash in different ways, so the cash flow statement is divided into three sections: cash flows from operations, cash flows from investing, and cash flows from financing.</p><h5>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:<br></h5><p>This section of the cash flow statement shows the amount of cash coming from sales of the company's goods and services, less the amount of cash needed to make and sell those goods and services (cost of goods sold, also known as “COGS”).</p><p>The Cash Flow from Operations section is the cash version of net income. Net income includes non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization, but excludes other cash expenditures such as purchases of plants or equipment. Companies that produce a net positive cash flow from operating activities usually perform well. Of course, there are several examples of companies that display poor cash flow and go on to become good performers. For example, growth companies such as technology firms tend to have negative cash flow from operations in their formative years and go on to be quite successful.</p><p>This “changes in cash flow from operations” section can sometimes indicate that there will be changes in net future income. It is usually a good sign when the change in cash from operating activities goes up.</p><p>Investors should be careful of an increasing gap between a company's net income and its cash flow from operating activities. For example, if net income is much larger than cash flow from operations, it's a sign that the quality of the company's net income is questionable. On the other hand, if the cash flow from operations is greater than the net income, the company may be healthier than its net income suggests. As an example, a pharmaceutical company shows net income of only $50 million. Its cash flow from operations is $230 million. One of the reasons for the large difference is that the large depreciation and amortization charges reduce net income, but since they really aren't cash outlays, these charges have no effect on cash flow.<br></p><h5>Cash Flows from Investing Activities:<br></h5><p>This section of the statement shows the amount of cash the company has spent on capital expenditures such as new equipment or anything else needed to keep the business going. The company is “investing” in itself. This section also includes acquisitions of other businesses and monetary investments such as money market funds.</p><p>It is a good rule of thumb for a company to reinvest cash back into its business by at least the rate of depreciation expenses each year. If the company does not re-invest, it might show artificially high cash inflows in the current year which may not be sustainable.</p><h5>Cash Flow From Financing Activities:<br></h5><p>This section of the statement describes the cash activities associated with outside financing. Usual sources of cash inflow would be cash raised by selling stock and bonds or by borrowing from a bank. Cash outflows or use of cash in this section would include paying back a bank loan, dividend payments and common stock repurchases.</p><h4>Free Cash Flow<br></h4><p>Knowledgeable investors are attracted to companies that generate a lot of free cash flow (FCF). Free cash flow is the excess cash produced by the company. Free cash flow indicates a company's ability to pay debt, pay dividends, buy back stock and facilitate the growth of business.</p><p class=text_ital>The most common method of calculating free cash flow is:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net Income<br>+ Amoritzation/Depreciations<br>- Changes in Working Capital<br>- Capital Expenditures<br>-------------------------------------<br>= Free Cash Flow</p><p>Amortization and Depreciation are non-cash expenses to account for the aging of equipment such as computers and buildings. Change is Working Capital is current assets minus current liabilities. Capital Expenditures are large purchases such as new equipment.</p><p>A company's ability to pay for its own operations and growth signals to investors that it has very strong fundamentals.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel5 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Where to find the financial statements</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Finding the Financial Statements: the 10-K and 10-Q<br></h4><p>The Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) requires all publicly traded companies to file periodic reports detailing their financial activities. These include the 10-K and 10-Q reports. These reports can be found on the internet (sec.gov/edgar, annualreports.com, the company’s website) or in printed form (you can e-mail or call the company to ask them to send you a printed copy).</p><h4>The 10-K and the Annual Report<br></h4><p>The 10-K is an annual report that discloses a business's performance for the company’s fiscal year. A fiscal year is a twelve month timeframe that the company designates for its business cycle. It could be January to December like the calendar year, or it could be April to March.</p><p>The 10-K is audited by an accounting company that is an unbiased, outside organization. In addition to finding a company's financial statements for the most recent year, investors can use the 10-K to access a business's historical financial measures along with information detailing the operations of the business. This information includes the number of employees, biographies of upper management, risks, future plans for growth, etc.</p><p>Companies also release an annual report. The annual report is basically the 10-K, but in a fancier, glossier format that functions more like a marketing piece meant for general investors. It includes most of the same information contained in the 10-K. There is a great amount of valuable information in a 10-K and it is considered required reading for any serious investor.</p><h4>The 10-Q<br></h4><p>The 10-Q filing can be thought of as a smaller version of the 10-K. It reports the company's performance after each fiscal quarter (the “Q” stands for quarter). Each year, three 10-Q filings are released - one for each of the first three quarters of the company’s fiscal year. There is no 10-Q for the fourth quarter because the 10-K filing is released at that time. 10-Q filings are not required to be audited.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel6 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>Other company information</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Other company information that is required by the SEC includes a management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A), an auditor's report, and a detailed description of the company's operations and prospects for the upcoming year.</p><h4>Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)<br></h4><p>As a preface to the financial statements, a company's management will talk about the recent year (or quarter) and provide background on the company. This is called the management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A). This provides a clearer picture of what the company does as well as pointing out some key areas in which the company has performed well.</p><p>The management discussion does not delve into all the details affecting the company's performance. The management's analysis is at their own discretion, therefore they tend to focus less on any potential negative aspects.</p><p class=text_ital>As a potential investor, here are some things to look out for:</p><ul><li class=ul>How accurate are management's comments?</li><li class=ul>Does management discuss significant financial trends over the past couple of years?<br></li><li class=ul>How clear are management's comments? If executives try to confuse you with big words and jargon, perhaps there is something to hide.<br></li><li class=ul>Do they mention potential risks or uncertainties moving forward?</li></ul><p>If a company gives a decent amount of information in the MD&amp;A, it is likely that management is being upfront and honest. If the MD&amp;A ignores serious problems that the company has been facing, this should raise a red flag.</p><h4>The Auditor's Report<br></h4><p>The auditor’s job is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are accurate and provide adequate disclosure.</p><p>Every publicly traded company is required by law to have its annual reports audited by a certified public accountants firm. An auditor's report is meant to scrutinize the company and identify anything that might undermine the integrity of the financial statements.</p><p>Audits give credibility to the figures reported by the management. You'll only see unaudited financials for unlisted firms (those that trade OTCBB or on the Pink Sheets). While quarterly statements aren't audited, you should be wary of annual financials that haven't been given the accountants' seal of approval. If the annual financials have been audited, the 10-K and annual report will contain a letter stating that the financial statements have been audited by the accounting company.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel7 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>The Notes to the Financial Statements</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Just as the MD&amp;A is an introduction to the financial statements, the notes to the financial statements, also called footnotes, complete the overall picture. If the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are the heart of the financial statements, then the footnotes are the arteries that keep everything connected.</p><p>The footnotes list important information such as outstanding leases, the maturity dates of outstanding debt and details on compensation plans, such as stock options, etc. There are two types of footnotes:</p><h4>Accounting Methods<br></h4><p>This type of footnote identifies and explains the major accounting policies that the company uses. This is important if a company has changed accounting policies. It may be that a firm is practicing \"cookie jar accounting\" and is changing policies only to take advantage of current conditions in order to hide poor performance.</p><h4>Disclosure<br></h4><p>This type of footnote provides additional information that could not be put in the financial statements. The financial statements are supposed to be clean and easy to follow. To maintain this cleanliness, other calculations are left for the footnotes. For example, details of long-term debt such as maturity dates and the interest rates at which debt was issued gives you a better idea of the timing of the borrowing costs. Other disclosure areas include pension plan liabilities for existing employees to details about legal proceedings involving the company.</p><p>Wise investors should dig deep and look for information that others typically overlook. No matter how boring it might be, read the fine print - it will make you a better investor and help you realize your goals more efficiently.<br></p></div></div><p><br></p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include=\"'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html'\"></div>--></div></div>"),a.put("app/fundamentalanalysis/fundamentalanalysis.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>Fundamental analysis was developed after the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These two laws require publicly traded corporations to provide full disclosure of financial and other information that can influence the price of their securities.</p><p>Fundamental analysis uses formulas to examine the financial strength of a company. Fundamental analysis involves looking into a company’s financial statements. The analysis is based on factors such as the value of the company’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, earnings, dividends and other fundamental data. Fundamental analysts look at this information to gain insight on a company’s future performance. This analysis can help you determine if investing in a particular company is right for you.</p><p class=text_ital>Fundamental analysis is useful in answering questions such as:</p><ul><li class=ul>Is a company’s revenue growing?<br></li><li class=ul>Is a company making a profit?<br></li><li class=ul>Is a company strong enough to beat out its competitors in the future?<br></li><li class=ul>Is a company able to repay its debts?<br></li><li class=ul>Is a company’s management trying to “cook the books”?</li></ul><p>You can think of fundamental analysis as a toolbox to help you answer this question: Is the company’s stock a good investment?<br></p><div id=CollapsiblePanel9 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Quantitative vs. Qualitative</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: none"><p>A company’s fundamentals include everything from it’s market share to the quality of its management.</p><p class=text_ital>These fundamental factors are grouped into two categories:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Quantitative</span><br>Quantitative fundamentals are the tangible factors of a business. These are the numeric, measurable characteristics of a company. A company’s financial statements are the biggest source of quantitative data.<br><br>An example of quantitative analysis is the Price/Earnings or P/E ratio. This ratio shows the amount of money investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings. The equation is the price of a company’s stock divided by its annual earnings. For example, if a stock sells for $50 per share and the company’s anticipated annual earnings are $5 per share, it carries a P/E ratio of 50/5 or 10. The P/E ratio of a company with negligible earnings is meaningless. A negative P/E ratio is sometimes found with new publicly traded technology companies.<br><br>The P/E ratio can be used to estimate the attractiveness of a stock. A company with a stock that has a low P/E ratio compared to its peers in the same industry could indicate that the stock is undervalued. On the other hand, a low P/E ratio could indicate problems with the company if the stock price has had a very large decrease. As an investor, you would want to look for a lower P/E number because this means that the stock is priced lower than those similar companies in that industry, but you also want to research the stock price history as well.<br><br>The normal P/E ratio range for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index is 13 to 15 during a bull (rising) market and 8 to 10 in a bear (declining) market. When the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 P/E ratio goes above the high end of that range, there is cause for alarm because the stocks are priced higher than their value. Eventually, stock prices are likely to fall back down to their actual values.<br><br>You can read more about financial statements in the Financial Statements section and can learn more about the various quantitative ratios in the Analyzing Financial Statements section.<br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Qualitative</span><br>Qualitative fundamentals are the less tangible factors surrounding a business. These include the quality of a company’s board members and key executives, its brand-name recognition, and its proprietary technology (i.e. patents).</li></ul><h4>Quantitative and Qualitative analysis</h4><p>Many analysts study both qualitative factors and quantitative factors in analyzing a company. For example, when examining Apple corporation, an analyst might look at the stock’s annual dividend payout, earnings per share, P/E ratio, and many other quantitative factors. But the analyst will also take into account its brand recognition. Anybody can start a company that sells computers, but few companies on earth are recognized by billions of people. It’s tough to put your finger on exactly what the Apple brand is worth, but you can be sure that it’s an essential ingredient contributing to the company’s ongoing success.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel1 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>What is intrinsic value?<br></div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: none"><h4>The concept of intrinsic value</h4><p>There are two major assumptions of fundamental analysis. The first assumption is that the price on the stock market does not fully reflect a stock’s “real” value. This assumes that the stock market is not always correct and that some stock prices do not reflect their “real” value. This “real” value is known as the intrinsic value.</p><p>For example, a company’s stock was trading at $20 per share. After doing extensive homework on the company, you determine that it really is worth $25 per share. In other words, you determine the intrinsic value of the company’s stock price to be $25 per share. This is important because an investor wants to buy stocks that are trading below their estimated intrinsic value.</p><p>The second major assumption of fundamental analysis is that in the long run, the stock market will reflect a company’s fundamentals. There is no reason to buy a stock based on intrinsic value if the price never reflects that value. Unfortunately nobody knows how long “the long run” really is. It could be days, months, or years.</p><p>By focusing on a particular business, an investor can estimate the intrinsic value of a company and thus find opportunities where he or she can buy at a discount. If all goes well, the investment will pay off over time as the market catches up to the fundamentals.</p><p class=text_ital>There are two unknowns in determining a stock’s intrinsic value. These are:</p><ul><li class=ul>You don’t know if your estimate of the intrinsic value is correct.<br></li><li class=ul>You don’t know how long it will take for the intrinsic value to be reflected in the stock market.</li></ul><p>Since qualitative factors represent aspects of a company’s business that are difficult or impossible to quantify, incorporating that kind of information into a pricing evaluation can be quite difficult. But you should not ignore these intangible characteristics of a company.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel2 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Internal qualitative factors<br></div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: none"><p class=text_ital>A company’s internal factors include the following:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Business model</span><br>A company’s business model describes exactly what the company does. It’s how a company makes money. A company’s website or the first part of its annual report can give a good overview of a company’s business model.<br><br>Sometimes business models are easy to understand. For example, McDonald’s sells hamburgers, fries, soft drinks, salads and whatever other seasonal special they are promoting at the time. It’s a simple model, easy enough for anybody to understand.<br><br>However, some business models can be complicated. For example, you would think that the business model for Boston Chicken is a fast food restaurant selling cooked chicken. The problem is that they didn’t make money by selling chicken. Instead they made their money from royalty fees and high-interest loans to franchisees. Boston Chicken was actually nothing more than a big franchisor. In addition, the management was aggressive with how it recognized its revenue. When it was discovered that all the franchisees were losing money, the house of cards collapsed and the company went bankrupt.<br><br>You should try to understand the business model of any company you invest in. If you don’t understand a company’s business model, you won’t know what the drivers are for future growth, and you could leave yourself vulnerable to being blindsided like shareholders of Boston Chicken were.<br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Competitive advantage</span><br>Potential investors should consider a company’s competitive advantage. A company’s long-term success is due to its ability to maintain a competitive advantage. Powerful competitive advantages, such as Coca Cola’s brand name and Microsoft’s domination of the personal computer operating system, create a moat around a business, allowing it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits. When a company achieves a competitive advantage, its shareholders can be well rewarded.<br><br>One type of competitive advantage is called operational effectiveness. Operational effectiveness means a company is better at performing similar activities than its rivals. An example is Toyota which used “Just-In-Time” process improvements to produce automobiles quicker than Ford or GM.<br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Management</span><br>A company relies upon its management to guide it towards financial success. Strong management is important because even the best business model can fail if the company’s management fails to properly execute the plan.<br><br>An investor can evaluate the management of a company by researching its website. Every public company has a corporate information section on its website. Usually there will be a short biography on each executive with their employment history, educational background and any applicable achievements. Be aware that companies put a positive spin on their management. A company doesn’t put negative information on its corporate website.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Here are a few ways to get a feel for the quality of a company’s management:</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Quarterly conference calls</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) hold quarterly conference calls. First, they review the financial results. Next is the interesting question-and-answer portion of the call. This is when the analysts can call in and ask management direct questions. The answers can be revealing about the company, but more importantly, listen for candor. Do they avoid questions, like politicians, or do they provide forthright answers?<br><br></span><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>The Management Discussion and Analysis is at the beginning of the annual report. The MD&amp;A is supposed to be frank commentary on the management’s outlook. Sometimes the content is worthwhile. One insight is to compare what management said in past years with what they are saying now. Is it the same material rehashed? Have strategies actually been implemented?</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Ownership and insider sales</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>Large companies will compensate executives with a combination of cash, restricted stock and options. It is a positive sign that management is also shareholders. The ideal situation is when the founder of the company is still in charge. When a majority of management’s wealth is in the stock, you can have confidence that they will do the right thing. It’s also worth checking if management has been selling its stock. These sales have to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so it’s publicly available information. Think twice if you see management unloading all of its shares while saying something else in the media.</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Past performance</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>Another way to get a feel for management is to check and see how executives have done at other companies in the past. You can find biographies of top executives on company websites. Like a resume, this shows the companies they worked at in the past. It is a good idea to do a search on those companies and see their performance.</span><br><br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Corporate governance</span><br>Corporate governance describes the corporate policies that explain the relationships and responsibilities between management, directors and shareholders. These policies are defined and determined in the company charter and its bylaws. The purpose of corporate governance policies is to ensure that proper checks and balances are in place, making it more difficult for anyone to conduct unethical and illegal activities.<br><br>Good corporate governance is where a company complies with all of its governance policies and applicable government regulations (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). With a little research and the right questions, investors can get a good idea about a company’s corporate governance.<br><br><span class=text_ital>Here are a some things to look for in corporate governance:</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Financial and information transparency</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>This aspect relates to the quality and timeliness of a company’s financial information and operational events. Sufficient transparency implies that a company’s financial reporting is clearly written so that the stockholder can follow what management is doing and therefore have a clear understanding of the company’s current financial situation.</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Stakeholder rights</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>This aspect of corporate governance examines how a company’s policies are benefiting stakeholder interests. Shareholders should have some access to the board of directors if they have concerns or want something addressed. Companies with good governance give shareholders a certain amount of ownership voting rights to call meetings to discuss issues with the board.</span><br><br></li><li class=ul2><span class=text_bld>Structure of the board of directors</span><br><span class=ul2_indent>The board of directors is composed of representatives from the company and representatives from outside of the company. The combination of inside and outside directors tries to provide an independent assessment of management’s performance, making sure that the interests of shareholders are represented.<br><br>The key word for the board of directors is “independence”. The board of directors is responsible for protecting shareholder interests and ensuring that the management of the company is doing the same. A board filled with insider representatives probably will not be objective critics of management and will defend their actions as beneficial, regardless of the outcome.<br><br>Information on the board of directors of a publicly traded company (such as biographies of individual board members) can be found in the DEF 14A proxy</span></li></ul></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>External qualitative factors</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent style="display: none"><p>Each industry is different in terms of its customer base, market share, industry-wide growth, competition, regulation, and business cycles. Learning about the industry will give an investor a better understanding of a company\'s financial health.</p><p class=text_ital>External factors include the following:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Customers</span><br>In general, it\'s not good if a business relies on a small number of customers for a large portion of its sales because the loss of a customer could dramatically affect revenues. For example, a military supplier who has 95% of its sales with the U.S. government could lose the majority of its sales if there is a change in government policy. For this reason, companies will always disclose in their annual 10-K report if any one customer accounts for a majority of revenues.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Market share</span><br>A company that possesses an 85% market share tells you that it is the largest player in its market by far. This could imply that the company possesses some sort of "economic moat," a competitive barrier that helps protect its current and future earnings. Market share is important because of economies of scale. When a company is larger than its rivals, it is in a better position to absorb the high fixed costs in a capital-intensive industry.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Industry growth</span><br>One way to examine a company\'s growth potential is to determine if the number of customers in the overall market will grow. This is crucial because without new customers, a company has to steal market share from its competitors in order to grow.<br><br>In some markets, there can be little or no growth. For example, a manufacturing company dedicated solely to creating audio cassette tapes might have been very successful in the \'70s, \'80s and early \'90s. However, that same company would currently have a rough time due to the advent of newer technologies, such as CDs and MP3s. The current market for audio cassette tapes is only a fraction of what it was during the peak of its popularity.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Competition</span><br>Examining the number of competitors in an industry helps in understanding the competitive landscape for a company. Industries that are difficult to get into because of the infrastructure costs (i.e. utilities, telecommunications) or industries with a large number of competing firms can create a difficult operating environment for companies.<br><br>One risk in a highly competitive industry is called pricing power. This refers to the ability of a supplier to increase prices and pass those costs on to its customers. Companies in industries that have few competitors can pass on costs to their customers. An example of this is Wal-Mart. They are dominant in the retailing business and they practically set the price for many of its suppliers. If you want to sell to Wal-Mart, you have little pricing power.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Regulation</span><br>Certain industries are heavily regulated due to the importance of the industry\'s products or services. These regulations can dramatically affect a company’s attractiveness as an investment.<br><br>In industries where one or two companies represent the entire industry for a region (such as utility companies), governments usually specify how much profit each company can make. In these instances, there is the potential for sizable profits, but these profits are limited due to regulation.<br><br>In other industries, regulations can have an indirect effect on pricing. For example, the drug industry is one of most regulated industries. No one wants an ineffective drug that causes deaths to be sold on the market. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that new drugs must pass a series of clinical trials before they can be sold to the general public. All this testing can take several years and millions of dollars before a drug is approved. All these costs are above and beyond the millions of dollars that the drug company has spent on research and development.<br><br>Investors should be on the lookout for regulations that could potentially impact a business. Investors should keep these regulatory costs in mind as they assess the potential risks and rewards of investing.</li></ul></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/fundamentalvstechnical/fundamentalvstechnical.html","<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class=\"page-header dark-green\">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class=\"panel panel-green\"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis are the two main schools of thought in the financial markets for analyzing publicly traded stocks.</p><p>Fundamental analysis uses formulas to examine the financial strength of a company.

The analysis is based on factors such as the value of the company’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, earnings, dividends and other fundamental data. Fundamental analysts look at this information to gain insight on a company's future performance.</p><p>Technical analysis evaluates securities by analyzing a stock’s market activity such as historical prices and volume. Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that may suggest future activity. Technical analysis studies supply and demand of a stock in the stock market to try to determine what direction, or trend, will continue in the future. Technical analysis tries to understand the emotions in the stock market by studying the stock market itself.</p><h3>The differences</h3><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Financial statements vs. Charts</span><br>A fundamental analyst focuses on the financial statements whereas a technical analyst approaches a security from the charts.<br><br>By looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement, a fundamental analyst tries to determine a company's value. In financial terms, an analyst tries to measure a company's intrinsic value. Investment decisions are fairly easy to make - if the price of a stock trades below its intrinsic value, it's a good investment.<br><br>Technical traders believe there is no reason to analyze a company's fundamentals because these are accounted for in the stock's price. Technicians believe that all the information they need about a stock can be found in its charts.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Time horizon</span><br>Fundamental analysis takes a relatively long-term approach to analyzing the market compared to technical analysis. While technical analysis can be used on a timeframe of weeks, days or even minutes, fundamental analysis often looks at data over a number of years.<br><br>The different timeframes for these two approaches is a result of the nature of the investing style to which they each adhere. It can take a long time for a company's value to be reflected in the market, so when a fundamental analyst estimates intrinsic value, a gain is not realized until the stock's market price rises to its \"correct\" value. This is called “value investing” and assumes that the short-term market is wrong, but that the price of a particular stock will correct itself over the long run. This \"long run\" can represent a timeframe of as long as several years.<br><br>The numbers that a fundamentalist analyzes are only released over long periods of time. Financial statements are filed quarterly (every three months) and changes in earnings per share don't occur on a daily basis. Fundamentals are the actual characteristics of a business. New management can't implement sweeping changes overnight and it takes time to create new products, marketing campaigns, supply chains, etc. Part of the reason that fundamental analysts use a long-term timeframe, therefore, is because the data they use to analyze a stock is generated much more slowly than the price and volume data used by technical analysts.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Trading vs. Investing</span><br>Technical analysis is more short term in nature than fundamental analysis, and the goals of a purchase (or sale) of a stock are usually different for each approach. In general, technical analysis is used for a trade, whereas fundamental analysis is used to make an investment. Investors buy assets they believe can increase in value, while traders buy assets they believe they can sell to somebody else at a greater price. The line between a trade and an investment can be blurry, but it does characterize a difference between the two schools.</li></ul><h3>Can they be used together?</h3><p>Although technical analysis and fundamental analysis are seen by many as polar opposites, many market participants have experienced great success by combining the two. For example, some fundamental analysts use technical analysis techniques to figure out the best time to enter into an undervalued security. Often, this situation occurs when the security is severely oversold. By timing entry into a security, the gains on the investment can be greatly improved.</p><p>On the other hand, some technical traders might look at fundamentals to add strength to a technical signal. For example, if a sell signal is given through technical patterns and indicators, a technical trader might look to reaffirm his or her decision by looking at some key fundamental data. Having both the fundamentals and technicals on your side can provide the best-case scenario for a trade.</p><p>While mixing some of the components of technical and fundamental analysis is not well received by the most devoted groups in each school, there are certainly benefits to at least understanding both schools of thought.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- end #mainContent --></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include=\"'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html'\"></div>--></div></div>"),a.put("app/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Getting Started</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading></div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><img src=../../../assets/images/93c1f138.yf.start.land.alt.png alt=image class=img-responsive><br><p>Welcome to Your Fund, where you can gain investment knowledge and create one or more customized funds based on your goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance.

If inflation is 3% per year, that means that prices, on average, will rise 3% over the next year, meaning that your dollar can purchase 3 cents less in a year than it can today. For example an apple costs $1.00 today. In one year, the apple may cost $1.05. The price has risen 5% and so the inflation rate for apples for that year is 5%.

With this system, you purchase more shares when the stock price is low and fewer shares when the stock price is high.</p><p>DCA cannot guarantee a profit or prevent a loss. However, it does reduce the effects of market fluctuations over the long term. The investor invests the same amount of money whether the share price is high, low or in between. The DCA system helps the investor avoid impulse buying and selling.<br></p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class=CollapsiblePanel><div class=CollapsiblePanelTabMain tabindex=0>When to Buy or Sell</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Buying / Holding a Stock<br></h4><p>It is important to be able to evaluate a stock in order to determine whether it is worth purchasing. The first step in analyzing a stock is to look at a company’s profile. This profile includes factors such as the price/earnings ratio, dividend rate, dividend yield and growth in future earnings. You can access a company’s profile on our website’s Research Detail page.</p><p>The company’s position in the industry, prevailing economic conditions, and your risk tolerance level will help determine your stock selections. A time-tested strategy is to invest in an undervalued stock based on the fact that over time the market price of a stock will tend to rise towards its perceived value, but as always with investing, there is no guarantee that the stock price will rise.</p><h4>Selling a Stock<br></h4><p>If you are playing blackjack and have won seven hands in a row, do you walk away from the table? Do you think, “I’m on a roll and I can keep going” or do you think, “I’ve made a good profit and I’m going to walk away?”</p><p>Selling a stock requires discipline. It can be extremely difficult to determine the right time to sell a stock. When a stock price rises, greed can get in the way of taking profits. There is an adage that says “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs just get slaughtered!”</p><p>When a stock price falls, it is reasonable to postpone selling because you hope the stock price will recover and rise back up. But if the stock does decline, will it ever recover to your initial purchase price or will it languish at a lower price? Given your time frame, how long do you wait to see if the stock will recover? These are factors to consider if the stock price declines.</p><p>If a stock was undervalued when it was first purchased and is still undervalued, then it makes sense to hold it until it becomes appropriately valued. If it is no longer undervalued, then it is a prime candidate for selling, regardless of how well it is performing at this time. This rule keeps emotions and greed out of the decision process.</p><p>After a stock has met your goals, unless there are overriding considerations, it should be sold. It is also appropriate to sell a stock if the reason the stock was purchased is no longer valid. An example would be purchasing a stock of a drug company which introduced a miracle drug. If the product fizzles, it is best to face the facts and sell the stock.</p><p>Spectacular success syndrome – Quite often a large rapid price increase signals trouble for a stock. For example, a technology stock, during one month, might skyrocket from 75 per share up to 135 per share based on either good results or speculation. On a stock graph, it would look like the ascent of a rollercoaster with a very sharp incline, not a gradual slope upwards. Often when this happens, the stock will become overvalued quickly, and like a rollercoaster, will decline very quickly as well. There is no consistent way to determine the peak of the stock price. If the stock price appreciation has met your criteria and goals for that stock on the way up, it probably is best to sell, even if the stock continues its ascent. If you have a longer timeframe, you could ride the stock up and then down and hope it goes back up, but there is no guarantee that the stock price won’t descent below your purchase price.</p><h4>Selling a Bond<br></h4><p>You can sell a bond before it matures if you need the money sooner than you expected. You may also sell a bond before it matures if the bond has increased in value due to a decrease in current market interest rates. Bonds are interest-sensitive, therefore fluctuations in interest rates and future interest rate movements can play a role in determining when to sell. Alternatively, you could hold the bond until it matures.</p><script></script><br></div></div></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/investmenttools/investmenttools.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><img src=images/yf.tools.land.alt.png alt="image"><p>Education can make you a better investor and empower you to make more informed investment decisions.</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Basics and concepts:</span> Learn about financial topics such as how to analyze financial statements, what is fundamental analysis, how to set your financial goals, and what is your risk tolerance.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Advantages:</span> Learn why investing can help you stay ahead of inflation, and why diversifying your investments can help you in both good and bad markets.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Glossary and definitions:</span> Understand investing terms and acronyms.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Research:</span> Research publicly traded stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds.

Mutual Fund is created by a company that invests in a collection of cash, stocks, bonds or other investments. Buying shares of the fund means that you own a portion of all of the investments within that fund. A mutual fund is run by a manager who chooses which investments to purchase. The mutual fund can sell its shares at the net asset value (NAV) at any time. The NAV value is calculated by adding the current market values of all securities in the fund’s portfolio, subtracting the liabilities, and then dividing the resulting figure by the number of the funds’ outstanding shares.</p><p>Mutual funds are classified as either load or no-load funds. Both types charge a management fee based upon the total dollars managed. Load funds also charge a direct commission (load) at the time of purchase. This is called a front-end load. There are also back-end loads, which are charged when the investor sells his/her mutual fund shares. A fund may charge a percentage of the NAV if shares are redeemed in the first year and a smaller percent in each subsequent year until the back-end load is reduced to zero.</p><p>Another mutual fund expense is the 12b-1 annual fee. This fee covers distribution expenses such as brokers’ commissions, marketing and advertising.</p><p class=text_ital>Mutual Funds are classified according to their investment objectives:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Aggressive Growth Funds</span> seek to maximize capital gains. They invest in new industries, fledgling companies, or industries that are temporarily out of favor. They are characterized by investing in high risk and high return stocks, but do not have significant interest income or dividends. These funds have growth potential in rising markets but are vulnerable to slumps and are therefore more attractive to risk-takers.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Balanced Funds</span> generally have a three-part investment objective: 1) to conserve the investors’ initial principal, 2) to pay current income, and 3) to have long-term growth of both principal and income. This is achieved through a mixture of bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Bond Funds invest</span> primarily in bonds. Some funds may concentrate on short-term bonds, others on intermediate-term bonds, and still others on long-term bonds. These funds offer dependable monthly income but rising interest rates can reduce the principal invested. This type of fund is for investors who want income and are looking to diversify. These funds are designed for low to moderate risk investors who seek a low to moderate rate of return.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Corporate Bond Funds</span> seek a high level of income by buying bonds of corporations for the majority of the fund’s portfolio. They are for investors who seek a low to moderate rate of return.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Growth Funds</span> aim to increase in value over the long term and usually do not pay dividends. They invest in companies that have strong earnings growth potential. While growth funds are good for long-term growth, they do not offer protection from temporary market declines. They are for long-term investors who want capital growth.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Growth and Income Funds</span> invest mainly in the common stock of companies that are expected to have an increasing share value and also have a solid record of paying dividends.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Income Funds</span> seek a high level of current income for their shareholders. This may be achieved by investing in stock of companies which have good dividend paying records.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Index Funds</span>recreate a particular market index (e.g. the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500). The investments in the fund and the return on those investments should mirror that of the index.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>International Funds</span> invest in the securities of foreign companies. International funds can be vulnerable to currency fluctuations. These can be for growth investors who want to diversify their portfolios.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Money Market Mutual Funds</span> invest in short-term securities sold in the money market. The money market is where large companies, banks and other institutions invest their surplus cash for short periods of time.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Municipal Bond Funds</span> invest in bonds issued by local governments such as cities and states. These entities use the money to build schools, highways, libraries, etc. These are best for investors who are interested in lower risk.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Precious Metals Funds</span> invest in gold mining and other precious metals-related companies. These funds are for investors who want a hedge against inflation.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Sector Funds</span> invest in one industry, such as biotechnology or retail, and thus are not as diversified as other mutual funds.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Total Return Funds</span> invest in high dividend paying bonds and stocks. These have comparatively steady gains in a variety of market conditions, but have modest results in strong economic times. These mutual funds are better suited for risk-averse investors looking for capital growth and moderate income.</li></ul><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- end #mainContent --></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/orientation/orientation.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Getting Started</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading><span style="font-size: 14pt">Orientation</span></div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p></p><p>“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”<br></p><p>This is our philosophy - to teach individuals how to invest and enable them to control their investment decisions.

People who perform technical analysis are referred to as “chartists” or “technicians” since much of their analysis takes the form of graphs or charts.</p><p>Technicians believe that there are recurring patterns in the movement of stock prices. Once these patterns are discovered, they can be used to forecast the direction and perhaps the magnitude of future price changes. Technicians also believe that investors will repeat their mistakes, failing to learn from either history or their own experience.<br></p><div id=CollapsiblePanel9 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>What is technical analysis?</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Technical analysis is a method to evaluate securities by analyzing a stock’s market activity such as historical prices and volume. Technicians look at the breadth of the stock market, the number of stocks with price increases, the number of stocks declining, their daily price changes, and the volume of the shares traded. Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that may suggest future activity.</p><p>Technical analysis studies supply and demand of a stock in the stock market to try to determine what direction, or trend, will continue in the future. Technical analysis tries to understand the emotions in the stock market by studying the stock market itself.</p><p>There are many different types of technical analysts. Some rely on chart patterns, others use technical indicators, and some use some combination of the two. A technical analyst\'s use of historical price and volume data is what separates her from her fundamental analysis counterparts. The only thing that matters to a technician is a security\'s past trading data and what information this data can provide about where the stock will move in the future.</p><p class=text_ital>Technical analysis is based on three assumptions:</p><ul class=ul><li><span class=text_bld>The market discounts everything</span><br>Technical analysis assumes that, at any given time, a stock\'s price reflects everything that has or could affect a company including any fundamental factors. Technical analysts believe that the company\'s fundamentals, along with broader economic factors, are priced into the stock.<br></li><li><span class=text_bld>Price moves in trends</span><br>In technical analysis, price movements are believed to follow trends. This means that after a trend has been established, the future price movement is more likely to be in the same direction as the trend than to be against it. Many technical trading strategies follow this logic.<br></li><li><span class=text_bld>History tends to repeat itself</span><br>An important idea in technical analysis is that history tends to repeat itself, mainly in terms of price movement. The repetitive nature of price movements is attributed to market psychology. In other words, stock traders tend to react consistently to similar market situations over time. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze market movements and understand trends. Although many of these charts have been used for more than 100 years, they are still believed to be relevant because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.</li></ul></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel1 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Technical analysis concepts</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>One of the most important concepts in technical analysis is the trend. A trend is the general direction in which a security or market is headed. As can be seen in Figure 1 below, the trend is up over the time frame shown.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure></p><p>However, it\'s not always easy to see a trend as seen in Figure 2. It isn\'t clear which direction this security is headed because there are many ups and downs in this chart.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure2></p><h4>Defining Trends</h4><p>Unfortunately, trends are not always easy to spot. This is because stock prices do not tend to move in a straight line in any direction, but rather in a series of highs and lows. It is the movement of these highs and lows that makes a trend. For example, an uptrend is a series of higher highs and higher lows, whereas a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs.</p><p>Figure 3 is an example of a stock price’s upward trend. Point 2 in the chart is the first high, which is determined because the price falls from this point. Point 3 is the low that is established as the price falls from the high at point 2. For this to remain an uptrend, each successive low must not fall below the previous lowest point. If the successive low falls below the previous lowest point, the trend is then known as a reversal.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure3></p><h4>Trend Types</h4><p class=text_ital>There are three types of trends:</p><ul><li class=ul>Uptrends<br></li><li class=ul>Downtrends<br></li><li class=ul>Sideways/Horizontal Trends</li></ul><p>Highs are also known as peaks and lows are also known as troughs. When each successive peak and low is higher, it is an upward trend. If the peaks and lows are getting lower, it\'s a downtrend. When there is little movement up or down in the peaks and lows, it\'s a sideways or horizontal trend. The sideways trend is not actually a trend, but a lack of a well-defined trend in either direction.</p><h4>Trend Lengths<br></h4><p>There are three trend length classifications. A trend can be a long-term trend, intermediate trend or a short-term trend.</p><p>In the stock market, a long-term trend usually lasts longer than a year. An intermediate trend lasts between one and three months and a short-term trend is anything less than a month.</p><p>A long-term trend is composed of several intermediate trends. These intermediate trends can sometimes move against the direction of the major trend. If the major trend is upward and there is a downward correction in the stock price followed by a continuation of the uptrend, the correction is called an intermediate trend. Short-term trends are components of both major and intermediate trends. Figure 4 shows how these three trend lengths might look.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure4></p><p>When analyzing trends, the chart should be designed to best reflect the type of trend being analyzed. For example, to help identify long-term trends, weekly charts or daily charts spanning a five-year period are used to get a better picture of the long-term trend. Daily charts are best when analyzing both intermediate and short-term trends. As a rule of thumb, the longer the trend, the more important it is. For example, a one-month trend is not as significant as a three-year trend.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel2 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Trendlines defined and uses</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Trendlines</h4><p>A trendline is a straight line in the chart that represents the general trend in the market or a stock. These lines show the trend and are also used to identify trend reversals.</p><p>Figure 5 shows an upward trendline that is drawn at the lows of an upward trend. This line represents the “support” the stock has every time it moves from a high to a low. This trendline helps traders anticipate the point at which a stock\'s price will begin moving upwards again. Similarly, a downward trendline is drawn at the highs of the downward trend. This line represents the “resistance level” that a stock faces every time the price moves from a low to a high.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure5></p><h4>Support and resistance<br></h4><p>A major concept of technical analysis is support and resistance. Support is the low level a stock price hits during a period of time. Support is like a floor for the stock price. Resistance is the high level a stock price hits during a period of time. Resistance is like a ceiling for the stock price. During some time periods, the price of a security seldom moves above (resistance) or below (support). Figure 7 shows support as the blue arrows and resistance as the red arrows.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure6></p><h4>Why does it happen?<br></h4><p>Support and resistance levels are important in terms of market psychology and supply and demand. Support and resistance levels are where a lot of traders are willing to buy the stock (in the case of a support) or sell it (in the case of resistance). When these trendlines are broken, the supply and demand and the psychology behind the stock\'s movements is thought to have shifted. In these cases, new levels of support and resistance will probably be established.</p><h4>Round numbers and support and resistance<br></h4><p>One type of universal support and resistance levels is round numbers. Round numbers like 10, 20, 35, 50, and 100 tend be important in support and resistance levels. They often represent major psychological turning points at which many traders make buy or sell decisions.</p><p>Usually buyers will often purchase a stock once the price starts to fall toward a major round number such as $50, which makes it more difficult for shares to fall below the level. Sellers start to sell a stock as it moves toward a round number peak. This makes it difficult for the stock price to move past this upper level. It is the increased buying and selling pressure at these levels that makes them important points of support and resistance.</p><h4>Role reversal<br></h4><p>Once a resistance or support level is broken, its role is reversed. For example, if the price falls below a support level, that old support level (floor) will become the new resistance level (ceiling). As another example, if the price rises above a resistance level, that old resistance level (ceiling) will often become the new support level (floor). For a true reversal to occur, it is important that the price make a strong move through either the support or resistance levels.</p><p>For example, in Figure 8, the dotted line shows a level of resistance that has prevented the price from heading higher on two previous occasions (Points 1 and 2). Once the resistance is broken, it becomes a level of support (shown by Points 3 and 4) by propping up the price and preventing it from heading lower again.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure7></p><p>In almost every case, a stock will have both a level of support and a level of resistance and will trade in this range as it bounces between these levels. This is most often seen when a stock is trading in a sideways pattern as the price moves through successive peaks and troughs, testing resistance and support.</p><h4>The importance of support and resistance<br></h4><p>Support and resistance analysis is important because it can be used to make trading decisions and identify when a trend is reversing. For example, if a trader identifies an important level of resistance that has been tested several times but never broken, he or she may decide to take profits as the security moves toward this point because it is unlikely that it will move past this level.</p><p>A break beyond a level of support or resistance does not always have to be a reversal. For example, if prices move above the resistance levels of an upward trending channel, the trend has accelerated, not reversed. This means that the price appreciation is expected to be faster than it was in the channel.</p><p>Support and resistance levels should affect the way an investor trades a stock. Traders should avoid placing orders at these major points, as the area around them can be marked by a lot of volatility. If you\'re bullish on a stock that is moving down toward an important support level, it is best not to place the trade at the support level, but instead, place it above the support level, but within a few points.</p><h4>Channels<br></h4><p>A channel, or channel lines, is two parallel trendlines that act as strong areas of support and resistance. The upper trendline connects a series of highs, while the lower trendline connects a series of lows. A channel can slope upward, downward or sideways. Traders will expect a security to trade between the two levels of support and resistance until it breaks beyond one of the levels. Then traders can expect a sharp move in the direction of the break. Channels are mainly used to illustrate important areas of support and resistance.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure8></p><p>Figure 6 illustrates a descending channel on a stock chart. The upper trendline has been placed on the highs and the lower trendline is on the lows. The price has bounced of these lines several times, but has remained range-bound for several months. As long as the price does not fall below the lower support or rise above the upper resistance, the range-bound downtrend is expected to continue.</p><h4>Trends are important<br></h4><p>It is important to be able to understand and identify trends. Two important sayings in technical analysis are "the trend is your friend" and "don\'t buck the trend." This shows how important trend analysis is for technical traders.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel3 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Volume of trades</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Volume</h4><p>Volume is the number of shares that trade over a given period of time, usually a day. The higher the volume, the more active the security. To determine the movement of the volume (up or down), chartists look at the volume bars that can usually be found at the bottom of any chart. Volume bars show how many shares have traded per period and show trends in the same way that prices do.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure9></p><h4>Why volume is important<br></h4><p>Volume is important because it can confirm trends and chart patterns. Any price movement with relatively high volume is seen as a stronger move than a similar move with low volume. If you see a large price movement, you should also examine the volume to see whether it tells the same story.</p><p>For example, a stock jumps 5% in one trading day after being in a long downtrend. Is this a sign of a trend reversal? If that day’s volume is high relative to the average daily volume, it is a sign that the reversal is probably for real. If the day’s volume is below average, there may not be enough conviction to support a true trend reversal.</p><p>Volume should move with the price trend. If prices are moving in an upward trend, volume should increase (and vice versa). If the relationship between volume and price movement starts to deteriorate, it is usually a sign of weakness in the trend. For example, if the stock is in an uptrend but the “up” trading days have lower volume, this indicates that the trend is starting to weaken and may end soon.</p><h4>Volume and chart patterns<br></h4><p>Volume is also used to confirm chart patterns. Patterns such as head and shoulders, triangles, and other price patterns can be confirmed with volume. If the volume is low at the pivotal moments of a chart pattern, the pattern is weak.</p><h4>Volume precedes price<br></h4><p>An important idea in technical analysis is that volume precedes price. Technicians monitor volume to look for upcoming trend reversals. If volume is starting to decrease in an uptrend, it is usually a sign that the upward run is about to end.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel4 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Charting</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Charts<br></h4><p>A chart shows a series of prices over a set time frame. For example, a chart can show a stock\'s price movement over a one-year period, where each point on the graph represents the closing price for each day the stock is traded:</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure10></p><p>Figure 10 is an example of a chart. It shows the price movements of a stock over a 1 &amp; ½ year period. The lower part of the graph, running horizontally (x-axis), is the date or time scale. The right hand side, running vertically (y-axis), is the price of the security. By looking at the graph we see that in October 2004 (Point 1), the price of this stock was around $245, whereas in June 2005 (Point 2), the stock\'s price is around $265. This tells us that the stock has risen between October 2004 and June 2005.</p><h4>Chart properties<br></h4><p>Charts have properties which are useful in understanding the information shown in the chart. These include the time scale, the price scale, and the price point properties.</p><h4>The time scale<br></h4><p>The time scale is the range of dates at the bottom of the chart. The most frequently used time scales are intraday, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the time frame, the more detailed the chart.</p><p>Intraday charts plot price movements within one day. The time scale could be as short as five minutes or could include the whole trading day.</p><p>Daily charts show a series of price movements in which each price point on the chart is a full day’s trading activity. Each point on the graph can be the closing price or the open, high, low and close for the stock over the day. These data points are spread out over weekly, monthly or yearly time scales to monitor short-term and intermediate trends in price movement.</p><p>Weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly charts are used to analyze longer term stock price movement trends. Each data point in these graphs will be a condensed version of what happened over the specified period. For example, in a weekly chart, each data point represents the price movement of the week. In a chart of weekly data spread over a five-year period with each data point representing the closing price for the week, the price plotted will be the closing price on the last trading day of the week, which is usually a Friday.</p><h4>The price scale and price point properties<br></h4><p>The price scale is on the right-hand side of the chart. It shows a stock\'s current price and compares it to past data points. The price scale goes from lower prices to higher prices moving along the scale from the bottom to the top.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel5 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Chart types<br></div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Chart types<br></p><p>There are four main types of charts that are used in technical analysis.</p><p class=text_ital>These chart types are:</p><ul><li class=ul>the line chart<br></li><li class=ul>the bar chart<br></li><li class=ul>the candlestick chart<br></li><li class=ul>the point and figure chart</li></ul><h4>Line chart<br></h4><p>The most basic chart is the line chart. This chart only shows the closing prices over a period of time. The line is formed by connecting the closing prices over the time frame. Line charts do not show the high, low and opening prices. The closing price is often considered to be more important than the high and low for the day and this is why it is the only value used in line charts. Figure 12 is a line chart.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure11></p><h4>Bar charts<br></h4><p>The bar chart expands on the line chart by adding more information to each data point. This chart is a series of vertical lines that represent each data point. This vertical line represents the high and low for the trading period, along with the closing price. The close and open are represented on the vertical line by a horizontal dash. The opening price on a bar chart is illustrated by the dash that is on the left side of the vertical bar.</p><p>The close is represented by the dash on the right. Usually, if the left dash (open) is lower than the right dash (close) then the bar will be shaded black, representing an up period for the stock, which means it has gained value. A bar that is colored red indicates that the stock has gone down in value over that period. When this occurs, the dash on the right (close) is lower than the dash on the left (open). Figure 13 is an example of a bar chart.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure12></p><h4>Candlestick charts<br></h4><p>The candlestick chart is similar to the bar chart in that there is a thin vertical line showing the period\'s trading range. The difference is the formation of a wide bar on the vertical line, which illustrates the difference between the open and close. Candlestick charts rely on different colors to explain what occurred during the trading period.</p><p>One problem with the candlestick color configuration is that different chart sites use different standards. Therefore, it is important to understand the candlestick configuration at the chart site you are working with. For example, when the price of the stock is up and closes above the opening trade, the candlestick could be white or clear. If the stock is down for the period, then the candlestick could be red or black. If the stock\'s price has closed above the previous day’s close but below the day\'s open, the candlestick will be black or filled with the color that is used to indicate an up day. Figure 14 is an example of a candlestick chart.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure14 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure13></p><h4>Point and figure charts<br></h4><p>The point and figure chart is not used by the average investor. This type of chart reflects price movements, but not time and volume. The point and figure chart removes insignificant price movements in the stock which can distort the price trends.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure15 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure14></p><p>Figure 15 is a point and figure chart. The point and figure chart is a series of Xs and Os. The Xs represent upward price trends and the Os represent downward price trends. There are numbers and letters in the chart which represent the months. Each box on the chart represents the price scale, which adjusts depending on the price of the stock: the higher the stock\'s price the more each box represents. For example, where the price is between $20 and $100, a box represents $1, or 1 point for the stock. The other critical point of a point and figure chart is the reversal criteria. The reversal criteria show how much the price has to move away from the high or low in the price trend to create a new trend. In other words, how much the price has to move in order for a column of Xs to become a column of Os, or vice versa. When the price trend has moved from one trend to another, it shifts to the right, signaling a trend change.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel6 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Chart patterns</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>A chart pattern is a formation that creates a trading signal. Chartists use these patterns to identify current trends and trend reversals and to trigger buy and sell signals.</p><p>The theory behind chart patterns is the assumption that history repeats itself. The idea is that certain patterns are seen many times, and that these patterns signal a high probability of a move in a stock. Based on the historic trend of a chart pattern signaling a certain price movement, chartists look for these patterns to identify trading opportunities. There is no chart pattern that will tell you with 100% certainty where a security is headed. This is why charting is often seen as more of an art than a science.</p><p>There are two types of patterns: reversal and continuation. A reversal pattern indicates that a trend will reverse course when the pattern is complete. A continuation pattern signals that a trend will continue once the pattern is complete.</p><p>There is a variety of chart patterns, each with its own unique name. Here is a sample of some chart patterns.</p><h4>Head and shoulders<br></h4><p>This is one of the most popular chart patterns in technical analysis. Head and Shoulders is a reversal chart pattern that when formed, signals that the security is likely to move against the previous trend. Figure 16 shows two versions of the head and shoulders chart pattern. On the left hand side, the head and shoulders top is a chart pattern that is formed at the high of an upward movement and signals that the upward trend is about to end. On the right hand side, the head and shoulders bottom, also known as an inverse head and shoulders, signals a reversal in a downtrend.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure15 name=figure width=530 height=300 id=figure15></p><p class=text_ital>Figure 16: Head and shoulders top is shown on the left. Head and shoulders bottom, or inverse head and shoulders, is on the right.</p><p>Both of these head and shoulders patterns are similar in that there are four main parts: two shoulders, a head and a neckline. The head and shoulders chart pattern illustrates a weakening in a trend by showing the deterioration in the successive movements of the highs and lows.</p><h4>Cup and handle<br></h4><p>A cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern in which the upward trend has paused but will continue in an upward direction once the pattern is confirmed.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure16></p><p>As you can see in Figure 17, this price pattern forms what looks like a cup, which is preceded by an upward trend. The handle follows the cup formation and is formed by a generally downward/sideways movement in the security\'s price. Once the price movement breaks above the resistance line formed in the handle, the upward trend can continue. This pattern has a wide ranging time frame, with the span ranging from several months to more than a year.</p><h4>Double tops and bottoms<br></h4><p>This chart pattern signals a trend reversal and is considered to be reliable. These patterns are formed after a sustained trend. The pattern is created when a price movement tests support or resistance levels twice and is unable to break through. This pattern is often used to signal intermediate and long-term trend reversals.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=530 height=300 id=figure17></p><p class=text_ital>Figure 18: A double top pattern is shown on the left, while a double bottom pattern is shown on the right.</p><p>In the double top pattern shown in the left hand side of Figure 18, the price movement has twice tried to move above a certain price level. After two unsuccessful attempts at pushing the price higher, the trend reverses and the price heads lower. In the case of a double bottom (shown on the right), the price movement has tried twice to go lower, but has found support each time. After the second bounce off of the support, the security enters a new trend and heads upward.</p><h4>Triangles<br></h4><p>There are three types of triangles: the symmetrical triangle, ascending, and descending triangle. These chart patterns can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=530 height=300 id=figure18></p><p>The symmetrical triangle in Figure 19 is a pattern in which two trendlines converge toward each other. This pattern is neutral in that a breakout to the upside or downside is a confirmation of a trend in that direction. In an ascending triangle, the upper trendline is flat, while the bottom trendline is upward sloping. This is considered a bullish pattern where chartists look for an upside breakout. In a descending triangle, the lower trendline is flat and the upper trendline is descending. This is considered a bearish pattern where chartists look for a downside breakout.</p><h4>Triple tops and bottoms<br></h4><p>Triple tops and triple bottoms are a reversal chart pattern. These two chart patterns are formed when the price movement tests a level of support or resistance three times and is unable to break through. This signals a reversal of the prior trend.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure22 name=figure width=530 height=300 id=figure19></p><p>Triple tops and bottoms can be confusing during the formation of the pattern because they can look similar to other chart patterns. After the first two support or resistance levels have been established, the pattern will look like a double top or bottom, which could lead a chartist to enter a reversal position too soon.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel7 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Moving averages</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><h4>Price movements and moving averages</h4><p>Chart patterns can show a lot of variation in price movement and this can make it difficult for traders to get spot a security\'s overall trend. One method to help see overall trends in price movements is moving averages. A moving average is the average price of a security over a period of time. By plotting a security\'s average price, the price movement is smoothed out. Once the day-to-day fluctuations are removed, traders are better able to identify the trend and increase the probability that it will work in their favor.</p><h4>Simple moving average (SMA)<br></h4><p>The most common method used to calculate the moving average of prices is called the Simple Moving Average. It takes the sum of all of the past closing prices over the time period and divides the result by the number of prices used in the calculation. For example, in a 10-day moving average, the last 10 closing prices are added together and then divided by 10. Figure 24 shows a moving average for 15 days as well as 50 days. The longer-term moving average is less responsive to changing prices because there are more days used in the calculation. Increasing the number of time periods in the calculation is one of the best ways to gauge the strength of the long-term trend.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure20></p><p>The usefulness of this type of average is limited because each point in the data series has the same impact on the average regardless of where it occurs in the sequence. The critics argue that the most recent data is more important and, therefore, it should also have a higher weighting. This type of criticism has been one of the main factors leading to the invention of other forms of moving averages.</p><h4>Uses of moving averages<br></h4><p>Moving averages are used to identify current trends and trend reversals as well as to set up support and resistance levels.</p><p>Moving averages can be used to identify whether a security is moving in an uptrend or a downtrend depending on the direction of the moving average. Figure 26 shows that when a moving average is heading upward and the price is above it, the security is in an uptrend. A downward sloping moving average with the price below can be used to signal a downtrend.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure1 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure21></p><p>Another method to identify a trend’s momentum is to look at the relationship of a pair of moving averages. When a short-term moving average is above a longer-term moving average, the trend is up. When the long-term moving average is above a shorter-term moving average, this signals a downward movement in the trend.</p><p>Moving average trend reversals are formed in two main ways: when the price moves through a moving average and when it moves through a moving average crossover. The first signal is when the price moves through an important moving average. For example, in Figure 27, when the price of a security that was in an uptrend falls below a 50-period moving average, it is a sign that the uptrend may be reversing.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure27 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure22></p><p>The other signal of a trend reversal is when one moving average crosses through another. For example, in Figure 28, if the 15-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it is a sign that the price will start to increase.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure27 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure23></p><p>If relatively short moving averages, for example 15 days and 35 days, cross over, this could signal a short-term trend reversal. On the other hand, when two averages with relatively long time frames cross over, for example 50 days and 200 days, this could suggest a long-term shift in a trend.</p><p>Moving averages can help identify support and resistance levels as well as provide useful support and resistance points. It is not uncommon to see a stock that has been falling stop its decline and reverse direction once it hits the support of a major moving average. A move through a major moving average is often used as a signal that the trend is reversing. For example, if the price breaks through the 200-day moving average in a downward direction, it is a signal that the uptrend is reversing.</p><p><img src="" alt=figure29 name=figure width=300 height=300 id=figure24></p><p>The most common time frames used to create moving averages are the 200, 100, 50, 20 and 10 day time frames. The 200-day average is thought to be a good measure of a trading year, the 100-day average measures a half a year, a 50-day average represents a quarter of a year, a 20-day average measures a month and a 10-day average represents two weeks.</p></div></div><div id=CollapsiblePanel8 class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed"><div class=CollapsiblePanelTab tabindex=0>Indicators</div><div class=CollapsiblePanelContent><p>Indicators are calculations based on the price and the volume of a security that measure such things as money flow, trends, volatility and momentum. Indicators are used as a secondary measure to the actual price movements and add more information to the analysis of securities. Indicators are used in two main ways: to confirm price movement and the quality of chart patterns, and to form buy and sell signals.</p><p>There are two main types of indicators: leading and lagging. A leading indicator precedes price movements, while a lagging indicator is a confirmation tool because it follows price movement. A leading indicator is thought to be the strongest during periods of sideways or non-trending trading ranges, while the lagging indicators are useful during trending periods.</p><p>The two main ways that indicators are used to form buy and sell signals is through crossovers and divergence. Crossovers are when either the price moves through the moving average or when two different moving averages cross over each other. The second way indicators are used is through divergence. This is when the direction of the price trend and the direction of the indicator trend are moving in the opposite direction. This signals that the direction of the price trend is weakening.</p><h4>Accumulation/Distribution line<br></h4><p>The accumulation/distribution line measures money flows in a security. This indicator attempts to measure the ratio of buying to selling by comparing the price movement of a period to the volume of that period.</p><p>This indicator keeps a running total over the period of the security. Traders look for trends in this indicator to gain insight on the amount of purchasing compared to selling of a security. If a security has an accumulation/distribution line that is trending upward, it is a sign that there is more buying than selling.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/transactionhistory/transactionhistory.html","<div class=row><div class=col-md-12><table class=\"row-border hover\" ng-table=tableParams ng-show=selectedFund.finalized><tr ng-repeat=\"stock in selectedFundHistoryItems\" ng-class=\"{ 'ymmfBackground': stock.symbol=='YMMF' } \"><td data-title=\"'Date'\">{{stock.date | date:'medium'}}</td><td data-title=\"'Symbol'\">{{stock.symbol}}</td><td data-title=\"'Company/Fund Name'\">{{stock.company}}</td><td data-title=\"'Price'\">{{stock.price | currency}}</td><td data-title=\"'# of Shares'\">{{stock.numberOfShares | number:2}}</td><!--<td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' \">({{stock.total | currency}})</td>--><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol != 'YMMF')\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">({{stock.total | currency}})</span></td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol == 'YMMF') && (stock.total != stock.numberOfShares)\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">({{stock.total | currency}})</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol == 'YMMF') && (stock.total == stock.numberOfShares) && (stock.description != 'Add money to YMMF')\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">({{stock.total | currency}})</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol == 'YMMF') && (stock.total == stock.numberOfShares) && (stock.description == 'Add money to YMMF')\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Action'\">{{stock.action}}</td><td data-title=\"'Explanation'\">{{stock.description}}</td></tr></table><table class=\"row-border hover\" ng-table=tableParams ng-show=!selectedFund.finalized><tr ng-repeat=\"stock in selectedFundHistoryItems | filter: {symbol : 'YMMF'}\"><td data-title=\"'Date'\">{{stock.date | date:'medium'}}</td><td data-title=\"'Symbol'\">{{stock.symbol}}</td><td data-title=\"'Company/Fund Name'\">{{stock.company}}</td><td data-title=\"'Price'\">{{stock.price | currency}}</td><td data-title=\"'# of Shares'\">{{stock.numberOfShares | number:2}}</td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol != 'YMMF')\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol == 'YMMF') && (stock.total != stock.numberOfShares)\"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">({{stock.total | currency}})</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Total'\" ng-show=\"(stock.symbol == 'YMMF') && (stock.total == stock.numberOfShares) \"><span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Buy' || stock.action == 'Add' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span> <span ng-show=\"stock.action == 'Sell' || stock.action == 'sell' \">{{stock.total | currency}}</span></td><td data-title=\"'Action'\">{{stock.action}}</td><td data-title=\"'Explanation'\">{{stock.description}}</td></tr></table></div></div>"),a.put("app/tutorials/tutorials.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>In Progress</p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/typesofbonds/typesofbonds.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>A bond is a security issued by a company or government. When you purchase a bond you are loaning money to the bond issuer. The issuer is borrowing money from the buyer of the bond (bondholder) and has agreed to pay specific amounts to the bondholder on the maturity date. These amounts are the periodic interest payments and the repayment of the principal.</p><p>The bond’s face value and interest rate are specified ahead of time. A bond’s coupon rate (the interest rate stated on the bond) depends on the market interest rate when the bond was issued as well as on the creditworthiness of the bond issuer.</p><p class=text_ital>Bondholders receive priority over common stockholders in two important ways:<br></p><ul><li class=ul>They must be paid interest before dividends are paid to stockholders.<br></li><li class=ul>They receive priority if the issuer’s assets are liquidated (i.e. goes bankrupt).</li></ul><p>Investing in bonds makes sense if you want the regular cash flow coming from the interest payments or if you do not need the money you invested right away. Bonds can be excellent for funding short-to-intermediate-term goals, since you can match the bond’s maturity date to the date you need funds.</p><p>Usually, the longer the maturity of a bond, the higher its interest rate. You are committing money for a longer period of time, so the bond issuer needs to compensate you for the length of time your money is tied up.</p><p>Bonds can also be risky investments depending on the issuer. They are susceptible to interest rate risk and inflation risk. Because a bond has a fixed coupon (interest) rate, when the price of a bond decreases, its yield increases. If the issuer is not financially strong, you would want a higher interest rate to offset the higher risk of the investment.</p><p>For example, say you purchase a $100 bond with a 10% coupon and one year later interest rates increase to 12%. The price of your bond on the market would drop. After all, why would someone buy a 10% bond when they can buy a 12% bond? Your 10% bond is not worth as much as a 12% bond, so if you wanted to sell it, you would need to sell it at a discount. It is important to note that when the stock market goes up, the bond market usually goes down and vice versa.</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s are bond rating agencies which regularly publish their bond ratings. The ratings range from AAA for the safest bonds to D for highly speculative bonds which may even be in default. The ratings of A or better are given to investment grade bonds, while speculative bonds are rated lower than BBB.</p><p class=text_ital>The following are types of bonds:<br></p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Callable bonds</span>, like other bonds, have a set maturity date. However, the bond’s issuer can call (redeem) the bond earlier than the maturity date. The issuer may do this if current market interest rates fall below the bond’s interest rate.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Convertible bonds</span> may be exchanged for a specified amount of other securities at the discretion of the bondholder. For example, the bond can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The owner of a convertible bond benefits if the price of the common stock rises.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Coupon bonds</span> pay interest at a stated annual rate (i.e. the coupon rate) with the annual payments usually divided into two equal semiannual installments. The coupon rate of a bond depends on the general level of interest rates at the time the bond is issued as well as the quality of the issuer.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Discount bonds</span> are issued at a discount from their face value and are redeemable at their face value on a specified date. There are no payments between the date of issue and the date of redemption. For example, you might pay $9,000 for a bond that will pay you $10,000 in five years. The discounted purchase price makes up for the fact that the bond pays no current interest. This is similar to a zero-coupon bond.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Guaranteed bonds</span> have interest or principal (or both) that are guaranteed by a company other than the bond issuer.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Income bonds</span> are unusual in that the interest is paid only if the corporation makes enough money to pay the interest. Most income bonds are regarded as speculative (risky).</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Mortgage bonds</span> are secured by a mortgage on a property or properties.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Secured bonds</span> are backed by the company’s assets. For example, mortgage bonds are secured by a conditional lien on part or all of a company’s property. If the company defaults (i.e. fails to pay interest or repay principal), the bondholders may foreclose the mortgage and take over the pledged property.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Tax-exempt bonds</span> are bonds where the interest is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. These are usually state and municipal government bonds. The interest rate is lower, but depending on your tax bracket, their after-tax returns may be higher than other types of bonds that are not exempt from federal taxes.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Unsecured bonds</span>, also known as debentures, are protected only by the general credit of the borrowing entity. All bonds issued by federal, state, and municipal governments in the United States are unsecured.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Zero-coupon bonds</span>do not have regular interest payments. Instead, they are purchased at a discount and mature at a higher face value. For example, you might pay only $9,000 for a bond that will pay you $10,000 in five years. The discounted purchase price makes up for the fact that the bond pays no current interest.</li></ul><p>All of these bonds are either <span class=text_bld>Registered bonds</span> or <span class=text_bld>Bearer bonds</span>. For registered bonds, the issuer maintains records on ownership. A bearer bond is more like cash in that whoever has physical possession of it is the owner. Registered bonds are safer because the bonds are registered to the person who purchased them and the issuer maintains the records.<br></p></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/typesofstocks/typesofstocks.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Investment Tools</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading>{{pageName}}</div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company issues shares of stock on a stock exchange in order to raise funds for its business expansion. Learn about investment concepts such as time value of money, inflation, and risk.</p><p class=text_ital>There are two main types of stocks:</p><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Common stock</span> shareholders are actually considered owners of the corporation. When the company does well, shareholders benefit from the increased earnings via a rising stock price and dividends. Stockholders are not personally liable for the corporation’s debts but if the company fails or has to liquidate its assets, common stockholders are the last to be paid. Owners of common stock are entitled to participate in certain aspects of managing the company, such as voting to elect directors and approving specified changes in the company’s charter. The majority of stocks traded are common stocks.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Preferred stock</span> shareholders are also owners of the corporation. Owners of preferred stock have the same rights as common stock shareholders. However, unlike common stockholders, they are entitled to a fixed dividend. This is similar to a bondholder who receives interest on a bond. Preferred shareholders are entitled to receive their dividends before common shareholders do. Some preferred shares are convertible into a fixed number of common shares. Preferred stocks are not as widely available as common stocks, and not all companies offer them. You can purchase preferred stock the same way you purchase common stock.</li></ul><h3>Stock Classifications</h3><ul><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Blue Chip Stocks</span> are stocks of companies with the strongest long-term performance. They represent financially stable companies with a history of paying steady dividends during economically good and bad years. These companies are usually the leaders within their industry or industry segment. Blue chip stocks include all of the Dow Jones 30 industrial companies as well as the stocks of other large, successful companies. Because blue chip stocks have high levels of quality and relative stability, they are viewed as attractive long-term investments. Blue Chip stocks include Exxon, Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Combined Return Stocks</span> are shares of companies that have characteristics of both income and growth stocks. They offer a combined return through dividends and price appreciation. These stocks usually do not have as high a dividend yield as an income stock, nor earnings growth as high as a growth company stock. Examples of combined return stocks include well established technology companies.Combined Return stocks include Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.<br></li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Cyclical Stocks</span> are shares of companies that are influenced by the economy and their industry’s business cycle. When the economy is doing well, the company’s profitability increases and the stock price rises. When economic conditions deteriorate, business for the cyclical company decreases and its profit declines. Cyclical industries include steel, paper, machinery, transportation, housing, oil and other natural resources. Cyclical stocks include US Steel, KB Homes, and Lennar.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Defensive Stocks</span> are shares of companies that are counter-cyclical and are more stable when the economy faces a period of uncertainty or decline. Prices of these stocks tend to remain stable during periods of economic downturn. These industries include food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, utilities and tobacco. Defensive stocks are usually recession-resistant. Defensive stocks include Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Bayer.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Growth Stocks</span> are shares of companies whose sales, earnings and share of the market are expanding faster than the overall economy and also faster than their industry average. The growth company usually focuses on research and reinvests its earnings into expansion. For this reason, growth companies pay relatively small dividends, if at all. Growth stocks are usually riskier and quite volatile. Their price can go up faster and farther than other stocks, but if the high rate of earnings levels off or is not sustained, prices can come tumbling down. Examples of growth stocks are rapidly growing technology companies with very strong sales. Growth stocks are better suited for investors with long-term time frames who are willing to assume the risk of a volatile stock. Examples of Growth stocks are Apple, Salesforce, and VMware.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Income Stocks</span> are shares of companies with a long, sustained record of paying high dividends. Generally, income stocks are in fairly stable and mature industries such as telephone and public utilities. These companies usually pay out a relatively high percentage of their earnings as dividends to stockholders. Because these companies distribute rather than reinvest their earnings, they are less likely to rise as high as growth stocks. They are also more likely to be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Income stocks are popular with people who need current cash flow from their stock investments. Examples of Income stocks are AT&amp;T, Verizon, Pfizer.</li><li class=ul><span class=text_bld>Interest-Sensitive Stocks</span> are shares of companies whose performance are influenced by interest rates. When interest rates rise, mortgage rates increase and property sales and construction declines. This decreases the demand for building supplies such as lumber, plumbing and household equipment. Conversely, when interest rates fall, mortgage rates decrease and home sales increase, boosting the demand for these supplies. Other types of interest-sensitive companies include life insurance, banks and utilities. Examples of Interest-Sensitive stocks are Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Metlife.</li></ul></div></div></div></div><!--<div ng-include="\'components/investmenttools/sidebar.html\'"></div>--></div></div>'),a.put("app/whatis/whatis.html",'<div id=page-wrapper><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><h1 class="page-header dark-green">Getting Started</h1></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class="panel panel-green"><div class=panel-heading><span style="font-size: 14pt">What Is Your Fund?</span></div><div class=panel-body style=font-size:12pt><div id=mainContent><p>Your Fund is an affordable on-line tool that lets you achieve your financial goals.
