            <p>“Fundamental, my dear Watson.”  If Sherlock Holmes was investigating a company, he would have used Fundamental analysis.  Fundamental analysis was developed after the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These two laws require publicly traded corporations to provide full disclosure of financial and other information that can influence the price of their securities.
            </p>
            <p>Fundamental analysis uses formulas to examine the financial strength of a company. Fundamental analysis involves looking into a company’s financial statements. The analysis is based on factors such as the value of the company’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, earnings, dividends and other fundamental data. Fundamental analysts look at this information to gain insight on a company’s future performance. This analysis can help you determine if investing in a particular company is right for you.
            </p>
            <p class="text_ital">Fundamental analysis is useful in answering questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Is a company’s revenue growing?
              </li><br>
              <li class="ul">Is a company making a profit?
              </li><br>
              <li class="ul">Is a company strong enough to beat out its competitors in the future?
              </li><br>
              <li class="ul">Is a company able to repay its debts?
              </li><br>
              <li class="ul">Is a company’s management trying to “cook the books”?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can think of fundamental analysis as a toolbox to help you answer this question: Is the company’s stock a good investment?<br>

                <p>A company’s fundamentals include everything from it’s market share to the quality of its management.
                </p>
                <p class="text_ital">Fundamental factors can be grouped into two categories: quantitative and qualitative.  </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Quantitative</span> <br>
                    Quantitative fundamentals are numeric and can be measured. The biggest source of quantitative data is the financial statements. You can measure revenue, profit, and assets easily.  You can view many quantitative tools from the Fundamental toolbox in the Analyzing Statements section.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the tools used in fundamental analysis is the P/E or Price/Earnings ratio.  This shows the amount of money investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings.  The equation is the price of a company’s stock divided by its annual earnings.  For example, if a stock sells for $50 per share and the company’s anticipated annual earnings are $5 per share, it carries a P/E ratio of 50/5 or 10.  The P/E ratio of a company with negative or negligible earnings is meaningless.  <br>
                    <br>
                    The P/E ratio can be used to estimate the attractiveness of a stock.  A company with a stock that has a low P/E ratio compared to its peers in the same industry could indicate that the stock is undervalued.  Also, a low P/E ratio could indicate problems with the company if the stock price has dropped substantially.  As an investor, you would want to look for a lower P/E number because this means that the stock is priced lower than those similar companies in that industry.<br>
                    <br>
                    The normal P/E ratio range for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index is 13 to 15 during a bull (rising) market and 8 to 10 in a bear (declining) market.  When the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 P/E ratio goes above the high end of that range, there is cause for alarm because the stocks are priced higher than their value.  Eventually, stock prices are likely to fall back down to their actual values.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can read more about financial statements in the Financial Statements section and can learn more about the various quantitative ratios in the Analyzing Financial Statements section.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Qualitative</span><br>
                    On the other hand, Qualitative fundamentals are the less tangible factors of a business.  These include things such as the quality of a company’s board members, brand-name recognition, patents, or proprietary technology. 
                  </li><br>
                </ul>
                <h4>Using both types of tools from the toolbox - Quantitative and Qualitative</h4>
                <p>Many analysts use qualitative factors with quantitative factors. For example, when examining Apple, an analyst might look at the stock’s annual dividend payout, earnings per share, Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio and many other quantitative factors. 
                </p>
                <p>However, no analysis of would be complete without taking into account its brand recognition. Anybody can start a company that sells computers and smart phones, but few companies on earth are recognized by billions of people. It’s tough to put your finger on exactly what the Apple brand is worth, but you can be sure that it’s an essential ingredient contributing to the company’s ongoing success.

               <h3>What is intrinsic value? </h3>
              </div>
             <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <h4>The concept of intrinsic value</h4>
                <p>There are two major assumptions of fundamental analysis.  The first assumption is that the price on the stock market does not fully reflect a stock’s “real” value.  This assumes that the stock market is not always correct and that some stock prices do not reflect their “real” value.  This “real” value is known as the intrinsic value.
                </p>
                <p> For example, a company’s stock was trading at $20 per share. After doing extensive homework on the company, you determine that it really is worth $25 per share. In other words, you determine the intrinsic value of the company’s stock price to be $25 per share. This is important because an investor wants to buy stocks that are trading below their estimated intrinsic value.
                </p>
                <p>The second major assumption of fundamental analysis is that in the long run, the stock market will reflect a company’s fundamentals. There is no reason to buy a stock based on intrinsic value if the price never reflects that value.  Unfortunately nobody knows how long “the long run” really is.  It could be days, months, or years.
                </p>
                <p>By focusing on a particular business, an investor can estimate the intrinsic value of a company and thus find opportunities where he or she can buy at a discount.  If all goes well, the investment will pay off over time as the market catches up to the fundamentals.
                </p>
                <p class="text_ital">There are two unknowns in determining a stock’s intrinsic value.  These are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">You don’t know if your estimate of the intrinsic value is correct.<br>
                  </li><br>
                  <li class="ul">You don’t know how long it will take for the intrinsic value to be reflected in the stock market.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since qualitative factors represent aspects of a company’s business that are difficult or impossible to quantify, incorporating that kind of information into a pricing evaluation can be quite difficult.  But you should not ignore these intangible characteristics of a company.
                </p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">Qualitative tools can be separated into internal and external factors.
                <br>
              </div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">
               <h3>Internal qualitative factors</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p class="text_ital">A company’s internal factors include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Business model</span><br>                    
                    An investor should ask: What does the company do?  This is referred to as a company's business model.  It's how a company makes money. You can get a good overview of a company's business model by checking out its website or reading the first part of its annual report.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes business models are easy to understand. For example, McDonalds sells hamburgers, fries, soft drinks, salads and whatever special item they are promoting at the time. It's a simple model, easy enough for anybody to understand. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, some business models can be complicated.  For example, you would think that the business model for Boston Chicken is a fast food restaurant selling cooked chicken.  The problem is that they didn’t make money by selling chicken. Instead they made their money from royalty fees and high-interest loans to franchisees.  Boston Chicken was actually nothing more than a big franchisor.  In addition, the management was aggressive with how it recognized its revenue.  When it was discovered that all the franchisees were losing money, the house of cards collapsed and the company went bankrupt.<br>
                    <br>
                    You should understand the business model of any company you invest in.  Unless you understand a company's business model, you don't know what the drivers are for future growth, and you could leave yourself vulnerable to being blindsided. <br>
                    
                  </li><br>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Competitive advantage</span><br>
                    Another factor is competitive advantage. A company's success is driven by its ability to maintain a competitive advantage and keep it.  Powerful competitive advantages, such as Apple's brand name and domination of the smart phone, create a moat around a business.  This allows it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits. When a company can achieve competitive advantage, its shareholders can be rewarded for a long time. <br>
                    <br>
                    One type of competitive advantage is called operational effectiveness.  Operational effectiveness means a company is better at performing similar activities than its rivals.  An example is Toyota which used “Just-In-Time” process improvements to produce automobiles quicker than Ford or GM.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Management</span><br>
                    A company relies upon management to guide it towards success.  Strong management is important because even the best business model is doomed if the executives fail to properly execute the plan.<br>
                    <br>
                    An investor can evaluate the management of a company by researching its website.  Usually there will be a short biography on each executive with their employment history, educational background and any applicable achievements. But every company puts a positive spin on its management.  No company puts negative information on its corporate website.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Here are a few ways to get a feel for the quality of a company’s management:</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Quarterly conference calls</span><br>
                  <span class="ul2_indent">The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) host quarterly conference calls. The first part of the call is management reading the financial results. The question-and-answer portion of the call is when the line is open for analysts to call in and ask management questions. Answers here can be revealing about the company, but more importantly, does management avoid questions, like politicians, or do they provide forthright answers?<br>
                  </span><br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">The Management Discussion and Analysis is found at the beginning of the annual report. The MD&amp;A is commentary on management's outlook. An investor should compare what management said in past years with what they are saying now. Is it the same material? Have strategies been implemented?</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Ownership and insider sales</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">Any large company will compensate executives with a combination of cash, stock, and options.  It is good that management are also shareholders.  When you know that a majority of management's wealth is in the stock, you can be sure that they will do the right thing.  It is also worth checking out if management has been selling its stock. This has to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so it's publicly available information. Be careful if you see management selling all its shares while saying something else in the media.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Past performance</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">Another way to get a feel for management capability is to check and see how executives have done at other companies in the past. You can normally find biographies of top executives on company websites. Identify the companies they worked at in the past and do a search on those companies and their performance.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Corporate governance</span><br>
                    Corporate governance describes the policies that state the relationships and responsibilities between management, directors and shareholders.  These policies are defined and determined in the company charter and its bylaws and regulations. Corporate governance policies are to ensure that proper checks and balances are in place, making it more difficult for anyone to conduct unethical and illegal activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Good corporate governance is where a company complies with all of its governance policies and applicable government regulations (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002).  With a little research and the right questions, investors can get a good idea about a company’s corporate governance.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text_ital">Here are a some things to look for in corporate governance:</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Financial and information transparency</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">This aspect relates to the quality and timeliness of a company’s financial information and operational events.  Sufficient transparency implies that a company’s financial reporting is clearly written so that the stockholder can follow what management is doing and therefore have a clear understanding of the company’s current financial situation.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Stakeholder rights</span><br>
                    <span class="ul2_indent">This aspect of corporate governance examines how a company’s policies are benefiting stakeholder interests.  Shareholders should have some access to the board of directors if they have concerns or want something addressed. Companies with good governance give shareholders a certain amount of ownership voting rights to call meetings to discuss issues with the board.</span><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Structure of the board of directors</span><br>
                  <span class="ul2_indent">The board of directors is composed of representatives from inside and outside the company. The combination of inside and outside directors attempts to provide an independent assessment of management's performance, making sure that the interests of shareholders are represented.<br>
                  <br>
                  Independence is the key word when looking at the board of directors. They are responsible for protecting shareholder interests and ensuring that management is doing the same.  A board filled with insider representatives will often not serve as objective critics of management and will defend their actions as beneficial, regardless of the circumstances.<br>
                  <br>
                  Information on the board of directors of a publicly traded company (such as biographies of individual board members) can be found in the DEF 14A proxy  </span></li></ul>

                <h3>External qualitative factors</h3>
                </div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p>Each industry is different in terms of its customers, market share, growth, competition, regulation and business cycles.  Learning how the industry works will give you a better understanding of a company's financial health and will round out the tools in your toolbox.  External factors include the following: 
                </p>
                <p class="text_ital">External factors include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Customers</span><br>
                    In general, it's usually a red flag if a business relies on a small number of customers for a large portion of its sales.  The loss of one customer could dramatically affect revenues. For example, a military supplier who has 95% of its sales with the U.S. government could have the majority of its sales wiped out if there is a change in government policy. For this reason, companies will disclose in their 10-K if one customer accounts for a majority of revenues.</li><br>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Market share</span><br>
                    A company that has an 70% market share means that it is the largest player in its market.  This could suggest that the company possesses some "moat," (a competitive barrier that protects its current and future earnings).  Market share is important because of economies of scale. When the company is bigger than its competition, it is in a better position to absorb the high fixed costs of a capital-intensive industry such as telecommunication.
                  </li><br>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Industry growth</span><br>
                    Another way of examining a company's growth potential is to determine whether the number of customers in the market will grow. This is important because without new customers, a company has to steal market share in order to grow and this could be expensive for the company.<br>
                    <br>
                    In some markets, there might be little or no growth.  For example, a manufacturing company dedicated to creating audio cassette tapes might have been very successful in the '70s, '80s and early '90s.  However, that same company would currently have a rough time due to the newer technologies, such as digital formats.
                  </li><br>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Competition</span><br>
                    Looking at the number of competitors is crucial in understanding the competitive landscape for a company. Industries that have limited barriers to entry and a large number of competing firms create a difficult operating environment for other companies.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the biggest risks within a very competitive industry is pricing power. Pricing power is the ability of a supplier to increase prices and pass those costs on to its customers. Companies in industries with few alternatives have the ability to pass on costs to their customers. Take Wal-Mart for example. They are so dominant in the retailing business, that Wal-Mart practically sets the price for any of the suppliers wanting to do business with them. If you want to sell to Wal-Mart, you have very little pricing power.<br>
                  </li><br>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Regulation</span><br>
                    Certain industries are heavily regulated due to the importance of the industry's products or services. Even though some of these regulations are important to the public, they can drastically affect the attractiveness of a company for investment purposes.<br>
                    <br>
                    In industries where one or two companies represent the entire industry for a region (such as utility companies), governments usually specify how much profit each company can make. In these instances, while there is the potential for sizable profits, they are limited due to regulation.<br>
                    <br>
                    In other industries, regulations can have an indirect effect on pricing.  For example, the drug industry is one of most regulated industries.  No one wants an ineffective drug that causes deaths to be sold on the market.  As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that new drugs must pass a series of clinical trials before they can be sold to the general public.  All this testing can take several years and millions of dollars before a drug is approved.  All these costs are above and beyond the millions of dollars that the drug company has spent on research and development.<br>
