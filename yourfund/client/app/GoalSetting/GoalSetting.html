            <p>[image of a road map] Setting your investing goals is similar to taking a trip. When you plan a trip, first you select your destination, then you decide how you're going to get there. 
            </p>
            <p>Let's say you live in Denver and want to visit Chicago. You could fly, drive, or take a train. The type of transportation you choose depends on how much time you have, how long you plan to stay, and how much money you're willing to spend. If you have plenty of time to get to Chicago, you can drive. Driving means using a map or GPS to determine which route you will take, researching where you will eat and sleep, etc. If your time is limited, you might choose to fly to Chicago, checking with the airlines to see which carriers service that city, along with the flight times and fares.
            </p>
            <p>The same type of planning applies when setting your financial goals. First establish a specific goal, then map out a route of how to get there. Focus your goals on the events that have a significant financial impact in your life, such as getting married, raising a family, buying a home, funding a child's education, dealing with aging parents, and retiring.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Your Financial Goals</h3>

            <p>Most people never take the time to identify their financial goals. They think about saving or investing in general terms, but don't specify what they are saving or investing for, nor do they think about how much money they will actually need to achieve their goals.
            </p>

            <p class="text_ital">Here are some examples of general financial goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Increase standard of living<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Have sufficient funds in the event of a serious illness<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Develop an investment program that will provide a hedge against inflation<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Accumulate a sizable estate to pass on to heirs<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Reduce debt<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Retire comfortably</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think about what on this list applies to you and your lifestyle goals. Once you determine your general
              financial objectives, the next step is to focus on your specific financial objectives.
            </p>

            <p class="text_ital">Here are a few examples of specific financial goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Pay for college<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a house<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Make home improvements such as remodeling a kitchen<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a car<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Take a dream vacation to Europe<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Secure retirement income for at least 20 years<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Save in advance of having children<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a retirement home<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Retire at the age of 60<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Start a small business</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whereas a general goal might be "I want to retire comfortably someday," the specific goal would be "I want to retire at age 65 with enough funds to keep my current standard of living." Writing down clear and specific goals will help you identify your risk and investing preferences.
            </p>

            <p>When setting your goals, remember to be realistic about reasonable returns from various types of
            investments. For example, if you are risk-averse it helps to have goals that are more long-term and involve lower rates of return versus a short-term, high-risk, potentially high-return investments. 
            </p>

            <h3>Factors to Consider when Setting Goals</h3>

            <p>Once you have identified your goals the next step is to prioritize them. There are four factors involved
            in prioritizing your goals. 
            </p>
            <p class="text_ital">Each of them is equally important. They are: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Investment Time Horizon<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Priorities<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Quantifying<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Personal Investment Profile</li>
            </ul>
	          <p>In each section, there are some questions to ask yourself.  Your answers will help you determine which types of investments will work best for you.
	          </p>
	         <h3>Your Investment Time Horizon</h3>
	          <p>The length of time you have to reach your goals is an important factor in determining which type of investment is best suited to meet these goals.  Investments that are appropriate for funding a long-term goal (i.e. retirement in 15 years) would generally not be appropriate for funding a shorter-term goal (i.e. saving money to buy a car in five years).  The reverse is true as well.  
	          </p>
	         <h3>Life Cycle Stages:</h3>
	          <p>Your time frame is influenced by your stage in the financial life cycle.  These stages can be classified into three broad categories:
	          </p>
	          <ul>
              <li class="ul">The <span class="text_bld">accumulation</span> stage begins at the start of the investor's financial life.  During this period, the investor is focused on accumulating basic assets like home and furnishings, providing for the children's education, building a nest egg, and accumulating cash reserves and emergency funds to meet unexpected contingencies.  <br><br>
              </li>
 	            <li class="ul">The <span class="text_bld">acceleration</span> stage is when the investor enters the peak earning years and hopefully feels secure about taking care of the family's basic and emergency needs.  During this time, the investor may become more willing to take risks, since he or she has the time and resources to recover from potential losses resulting from investment risks.   <br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">The <span class="text_bld">preservation</span> stage begins when the investor is preparing for retirement.  At this point, it is difficult to bounce back from investment losses resulting from taking high risks.  The goal of this stage is to preserve capital accumulated during the previous stages as other income sources may taper off.   <br><br>
              </li>
	           </ul>
	          <p>Questions to ask yourself:</p> 
	         <ol>
	           <li class="ol">What is my time horizon for each goal?  Three years, five years or more? <br><br>
             </li>
             <li class="ol">Do I foresee any specific need to withdraw principal during that time?<br><br>
             </li>
             <li class="ol">What is a comfortable emergency reserve to meet unanticipated needs?<br><br>
             </li>
	         </ol>

          <h3>Your Priorities:</h3>
	         <p>You must prioritize the financial goals you have identified and decide which are necessary and which are merely desirable.  Depending on your time frame, you may need to invest for your highest priority goals before investing in your lower priority goals.  Short-term goals such as paying the mortgage or credit card debt may require the most immediate attention.  Medium-term goals might include starting a college savings plan or saving for a new car.  Long-term goals might include purchasing retirement property or saving for retirement.
	         </p>
           <br>
	        <p>Questions to ask yourself:</p>  
	       <ol>
	         <li class="ol">What are my most pressing financial goals? <br><br>
          </li>
         </ol>
        <h3>Quantifying:</h3>
	       <p>After determining your financial priorities, you will want to quantify your goals.  If you want to purchase a new car in five years, you need to determine how much the car will cost at that time.  The ability to reach your goal depends on the amount you plan to invest and the time frame to reach that goal.  
	       </p>
	       <p>For example, If your target is $10,000, you invest $5,000, and your time frame is two years, you need a total rate of return of 50%.  Such a high rate of return would require investing in high risk stocks given the short time frame.  If you do not want to take such a high risk, you might need to reduce your goal, lengthen your time frame, or increase your initial investment.
	       </p>
	       <p>An example of quantifying a goal is saving for college.  To anticipate your child's future college costs, first determine what these costs are today, based on the college or type of college you expect your child to attend.  Don't forget to include tuition, room and board, books, and travel costs.  Next, multiply those costs by an estimated inflation factor.  The more years until college starts, the larger the inflation factor should be.
	       </p>
         <br>
	       <p>Questions to ask yourself:</p>  
	      <ol>
	       <li class="ol">How much would I like to see my assets grow to in three years? Five years?  10 years? <br><br>
         </li>
         <li class="ol">What annual rate of return do I need to achieve from my investments? 10%, 20%, 35%, 50%?<br><br>
         </li>
         <li class="ol">Do I want these investments to provide me with current income, like dividends?<br><br>
         </li>
	       <li class="ol">Have I considered all the costs associated with that goal?<br><br>
         </li>
	      </ol>

       <h3>Your Personal Investment Profile:</h3>
	      <p>Your personal investment profile is the key to determining which types of investments are right for you.  Your investment profile is shaped by your age, the stage of your career, your required rate of return, and your risk tolerance level.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Questions to ask yourself:</p>  
	      <ol>
	       <li class="ol">Is the risk of losing some of the investment once every three years tolerable to me?  Once in five years?  Once in 10 years? Never? <br><br>
         </li>
         <li class="ol">Is a risk of extreme loss of the investment (greater than 15%) tolerable to me once every five years?  Once every 10 years? Never?<br><br>
         </li>
	      </ol>

      <h3>Putting it All Together:</h3>
       <p>Goal setting involves specifying your goals, your risk tolerance, the time frame to achieve the goals, and your financial life cycle stage.  Here is an example of how these principles might be applied:  
       </p>
       <p>Suppose you are a 45-year old parent with a 10-year old daughter.  You want to make sure you'll have enough money to fund your daughter's college expenses. Since your daughter is 10, you have eight years to accumulate funds. 
       </p>
       <p>Let's say you have $20,000 to invest, and need to get to $85,000 to pay for four years of college.  These costs include estimated tuition, room and board, travel costs and books.  You are in the acceleration stage of your life cycle as you are working full time, and your risk tolerance level is moderate.  In other words, you are fine with growth stocks, but also want to have income stocks to counterbalance and diversify your portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>Initially, you might choose 85% growth stocks (such as Apple, Amazon, Mosaic) and 15% income stocks (such as GE, J&amp;J).  As the number of years until college decreases, you might shift to a mix of 50% growth stocks and 35% income stocks, and 15% bonds.  Eventually, with college a couple of years away, you might shift again to 15% growth stocks, 30% income stocks, and 55% bonds and cash. 
       </p>
       <p>Goal setting is up to you since they are YOUR goals, YOUR timeframe and YOUR risk levels, no one elses.  One you have determined your goals, you can set up your own customized funds.
